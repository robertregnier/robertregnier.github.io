		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: silver;">
		The first step is to recognize that most if not all of these sites were 
		created by shamans. If you don’t agree with this then the answer would 
		be - they are just ancient graffiti (that’s no joke, as there are some 
		misguided academics that think this way). If you agree they were created 
		by shamans then it is logical to recognize that the rock art is a 
		recording of a shaman’s work or experience.

		<span class="style2">Here lies the problem, if you are not a practicing 
		shaman you will never recognize the language of the teaching. The truth 
		is without <u>experience</u> in the nonphysical realities there is no 
		way someone could ever understand what has been experienced. The only 
		ones that have the right to comment on what the cave and rock drawings 
		are, is the practicing shaman. This is the only credential that counts 
		in the interpretation of the meanings. Intellectual based 
		interpretations are at the best, a guess.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: silver;">

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%">
		<span class="style2">The second type is a recording of a universal 
		connection. This connection is to universal consciousness and that is a 
		source that all have the ability to connect to. In other words this type 
		of recoding is a teaching map for others to follow. This can be for 
		healing (balance) or teaching of acquired knowledge. All understandings 
		and knowledge from the past, present, and future are available here. 
		There are no exceptions but there are limiting abilities. The ability to 
		connect to unlimited universal knowledge is centered in the self limited 
		profile of the person asking. Every human on this planet is culturally 
		bound in one depth or another. The more we understand our reality, based

		Tassili National Park, Algeria. In my work with the pictographs I have 
		been shown parts of the process and some of the experiences that the 
		artists are portraying. On the left “A” diagram it shows the teachers 
		experience (large center one) and the students that followed record 
		their experience as part of the group knowledge. In “B” the shaman is 
		demonstrating the energy flow (snake shape and central axis flow at 
		center of body) with the power animals being the guides to the 
		experience. In “C” the energy felt is shown by a lightning bolt in the 
		mouth. The bird in hand demonstrated the OBE. In “D” you can see a 
		common theme in arm positioning. (No it’s not an alien!) Most 
		petroglyphs show the Mudra or body position to connect to the desired 
		energies and the proper angle of exit into specific realities. They are 
		all maps to certain “terrains” in the nonphysical. For on mudras with

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">The Petroglyph below is from South Western USA and 
		shows the workers at this site have achieved the highest semi physical 
		experience possible. It is the opposite direction of the Dorajuadoik or 
		towards the higher vibrational realities. This shaman’s introductory 
		stage is represented in the figure to the left. As time and experience 
		in these realms expanded the connection became more experiential or into 
		the consciousness spectrum. This can be seen in the middle figure, 
		followed in time by the last one to the right. You can see the 
		progression of complexity as the shaman’s vibration began to match that 
		of the contact entity. The shaman’s vision is now entering into a wider 
		value of the energy that is supporting the experience. The right side is 
		the completion of this one’s work. In the right side one, the shaman has 
		drawn shells of energy and the top of a complete orb that surrounds the 
		entity. The “wings” of “angels” are the energy flow connections to 
		different vibrational reality shells. The word Shells in this context is 
		a very complex understanding that evolves time, realities, and all 
		physical creations. It has yet to be recognized by the academic world.

		balance physical representation with the nonphysical aspects of creation 
		to its sides – higher vibratory aspect on one side and the lower 
		vibratory level of oneself on the other side. Each creates the push pull 
		of center balance and ascension. In all orbs there is a central flow or 
		axis (see book Schematic of God for introduction). Also, in all orbs 
		there is an event horizon that runs at 90 degrees. The event horizon and 
		axis create the 8 pack (8 smaller orbs) or inner orb structure. It is at 
		the center of the axis crossing with the event horizon that octahedron 
		is formed. The physical reality is a creation of this octahedron 
		structure and with its energetic shape, the organization of all of the 
		elements that form physical. This 90 degree event horizon is a balance 
		state of flowing energy as represented by the birds in fight symbol. 
		Birds in fight are a balance between realities or the capacity to “float

		publication. Unfortunately the artist is not a shaman as they would 
		recognise the quartz vein to the left of the frog figure. This vein was 
		is a source of power for the figure as seen by the energy tentacle 
		coming from it. The rock cracks are also used as entrances and exist 
		from realities. Without these things being recognized behind and to the 
		sides of the painting only half the information is recorded. Use only

		<em>&quot;Like bemused gallery goers, Clottes&#39;s team spends long hours 
		staring at a painting and asking, what - does it mean? One clue comes 
		from how the images are integrated into the walls. In the &quot;Goldilocks&quot; 
		chamber, the missing hindquarters of a cave bear drawn in red ochre seem 
		to lie within rather than on the rock. &quot;The bear seems to come out of 
		the wall,&quot; says Clottes. And last week Clottes&#39;s team discovered two 
		painted ibexes in the same chamber. The horns of one are actually</em><u><em> 
		cracks</em></u><em> in the wall which the artist scraped and enlarged. 
		&quot;To these people&#39;s way of thinking, those animal spirits were in the 
		walls,&quot; says Clottes. Painting them, the artists may have believed, 
		allowed the power within to seep into the real world.</em><o:p>&quot;</o:p></p>

		&quot;There is good reason to doubt chronologies based purely on style, 
		admits Chris Witcombe, an art historian at Sweet Briar College in 
		Virginia. He explains the difficulty with an analogy: &quot;Imagine you are 
		living in the distant future and only two objects survive from a lost 
		and forgotten past: a painting by Picasso and a painting by 
		Michelangelo. Which is the earlier work and which the later?&quot;</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black;

		But archaeologists must also be wary of radiocarbon dates, argue Pettitt 
		and Bahn in a paper that appeared in Antiquity last month. Bahn&#39;s 
		suspicions were aroused when he translated the latest coffee-table book 
		on the Chauvet cave into English. Around 30 radiocarbon ages are 
		presented in this book, but the measurements were all made at the same 
		French laboratory. Using results from only one team, however skilled, 
		just is not scientific, says Bahn. </span>

		Worse, the same laboratory is currently embroiled in an argument over 
		the age of the artwork in another cave, Candamo in Spain. They dated 
		black dots on its walls to 30,000 years ago, but Geochron Laboratories 
		in Cambridge, Massachusetts, estimated the age of a second sample to be 
		just half that.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

		The point is that carbon dating rock art is difficult. Because the 
		samples tend to be incredibly tiny, it is difficult to measure the 
		number of carbon-14 atoms relative to other carbon isotopes - the key 
		ratio for pinning down the age. </span>

		&quot;Everybody agrees there are problems,&quot; says Marvin Rowe, who heads a 
		radiocarbon-dating lab at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. 
		Contamination from groundwater or rock scrapings may further confuse the 
		results.&quot; </span>
