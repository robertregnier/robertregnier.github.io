		are many that would say purchasing artifacts only encourages looting of 
		sites. For others it is deemed disrespectful towards the ones that 
		created them (the ancestors) - nothing could be farther from the truth. 
		Unfortunately sites have and will always be looted just as other things 
		in our society are taken advantage of by those whose greed supersedes 
		their moral obligations. If you are truly in touch with the ancient ones 
		it doesn’t take long to find out their attitude on this subject. On 
		spiritual levels they are well aware of the need to teach the old ways 
		as well as participate in healing this modern culture. I can understand 
		that if you don’t know how to connect to these artifacts you would 
		develop an attitude of distrust and distain for their perceived 
		disturbance. The truth is there is no better source of information other 
		than being in the past itself. All artifacts and ancient sites have 
		latent imprinted energies that are there for those that are interested. <o:p></o:p>

		As you can imagine it is not that easy locating artifacts for this 
		shamanic work as most are in museums and private collections, which are 
		limited to only a few privileged researchers. The definition of these 
		researchers would be those that fit into the accepted paradigm of the 
		academic belief system. Personally I have no need to collect for the 
		sake of having a collection (it has a flavour of bragging rights to it). 
		When starting off with this method of research we need the physical 
		artifact as an introduction, a handshake you could say, but after 
		working with them for a period they are known to us on many levels. 
		Remember the connection will never be lost, it is there for life for 
		these connections are not physical in the first place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		From what I have been shown and taught (by the past teachers) the insult 
		to them is the hiding of these precious creations, be it in museum 
		drawers or having them reburied. Connecting to these past people through 
		shamanic work is priceless and necessary for some cultural groups as 
		they hold the energy patterns of the past and the balance of the future. <o:p></o:p>

		<span class="style2">Ancient sites, stone circles (Medicine Wheels) are 
		also excellent tools for they too are teaching centers for those who 
		want to listen. The original energy and teachings are still there just 
		like the original hard drive information is still there on your old 
		Pentium 1 computer, even if the information has been erased. Both may be 
		dated information but if you know how to access this so called lost 
		information, it is still available. Retrieving the old information from 
		the computer or in this case the ancient site still requires the old 
		operating system to make the translation possible. You cannot learn the 
		ancient ways from modern teachers no matter how bright or educated they 
		are. That includes the teachings of European “exposed” elders, going 
		back 100 years or more. We are all familiar with the history of a couple 
		of hundred years of European influence and interference. To go further 
		with this; the elders of a few hundred years ago would not know the ones 
		from thousands years prior. An example of this can be found in the 
		documented diaries of the first explorer’s inquires into what the stone 
		circles were. The answer they receive from the local populations were
		<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">“We don’t know they were there

		<span class="style2">We can use both types of tools (artifacts and 
		sites) to contact the originators or creators personalities or their 
		spiritual essence, for time doesn’t exist on these spiritual levels. For 
		the channeller, physic, or shaman, using the new tools on this website, 
		can produce extremely valuable information for us. An artifact can tell 
		an experienced researcher the spiritual desires in the creator, what 
		time period it is from, the cultural aspects, and the personal hopes and 
		fears of the individual that created it (all depends on your interest). 
		The information I have received from my temporary collection is so vast 
		that I will never get around to publishing most of it. The information 
		also goes into areas that are not currently “politically” accepted 
		(another reason to stay silent).</span><span class="style2" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

		I call it my temporary collection for 90% of the artifacts (purchased on 
		E-Bay) will probably be returned to the same source from where they came 
		(without prejudice). My plan is to first offer them to people that find 
		this website. That is if they have the interest in trying to use them. 
		Those that are not purchased on this website will end up back on E-Bay. <o:p></o:p>

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		When purchasing an artifact I tend to stay with stone. “Stone is the 
		recorder of history”, as the old Native Shamans would say. Quartz is one 
		of the best for recording as this material can be found in almost all 
		stone tools as silica dioxide. Ceramic or pottery might be another 
		avenue for you but it is even more impossible to get true artifacts. The 
		best way would be to purchase from a well known reputable dealer or just 
		obtain broken pieces like potsherds. Again there is little profit in 
		creating broken potsherds and the same rules apply; all you need is one 
		piece. It doesn’t have to be the whole object. Some believe that 90% of 
		the ceramics on E-Bay are recent forgeries from third world countries. 
		It is so bad that the fakes have worked themselves into the professional 
		collections and museums of the world. Forging artifacts started over a 
		hundred years ago, so even if they have an old appearance it doesn’t 
		guarantee antiquity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		I also try to obtain tools rather than personal objects like beads and 
		other adornments. My personal feelings on items (other than tools) are 
		their initial purpose, that being from a different perspective of life 
		and culture in general. In my reasoning, personal adornment is a 
		complement to ones emotional self and/or the establishment of social 
		status. I prefer tools for they are objects that are used to support 
		life rather than dressing it up for the personal expression. <o:p></o:p>

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		Due to the many reproductions for sale, we need to have some knowledge 
		of these tools. This can take years to learn, for it generally requires 
		experience at seeing and handling them. There are two ways you can 
		circumnavigate the possibility of purchasing fakes. The easiest would be 
		to acquire artifacts that I have up on this website for I guarantee that 
		they are originals. I cannot guarantee that everyone can connect with 
		them the same way I have experienced but what I can say is the results 
		will be varied due to the infinite differences in all of us. This is why 
		I would like to try to give some of them a small introduction without 
		pre-programming the purchaser’s own experiences. The purpose of this 
		website is to teach and not as a profit avenue. I could just as easily 
		put them back on E Bay and sell them. This would mean that they would be 
		placed into the hands of collectors, not my ideal of sharing knowledge. <o:p></o:p>

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		<span class="style2">The second and most valuable way is to use dowsing 
		rods, as this method should be used regardless of where you purchase 
		them. <u>This includes the ones on this site.</u> I will give some basic 
		dowsing instructions at the bottom of this page. Dowsing can bypass our intellect 
		and the visual stimulus that draw an object to us, without realizing the 
		value of it until the work is done. Sometimes the most unappealing 
		broken ones turn out to be the best teachers. I have personally 
		purchased artifacts that produced no teachings <u>for me</u> while 
		intellectually they should have great potential. Only the higher aspects 
		of us really knows the best for our current or future needs. </span> <o:p></o:p>

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		Remember when choosing an artifact, it may be unrelated to our present 
		life but still have great influence here. We might still be healing our 
		personal past or a past aspect of us that has balancing or shareable 
		energies for us. It may be for our present balance or a preparation for 
		a future cycle we are about to enter. On top of this it could be based 
		on emotional, intellectual, spiritual or physical needs. You see there 
		are too many variables, as our intellect is the poorest “steering wheel” 
		here is for this work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		<span class="style2">Start intellectually by determining your budget and 
		then which ones you think you need based on desired interests of 
		cultural age or area of origin. Open up as many Browser tabs (pages) as 
		needed for each artifact of interest. Starting at one page with rods in 
		hand, ask if this artifact would be of great learning or teaching for 
		you. You may also simply ask if you should purchase this one. 
		The rods will tell you or they may be silent (no movement). Go to the 
		next page and repeat until you have gone through the ones you have 
		chosen. If you received nothing from your selection, repeat it a few 
		days later as we will work on many levels and even during our sleep 
		state. If there is nothing on this site try E-Bay.</span><span class="style2" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		</span><span class="style2">If you are not certain about the 
		authenticity of the article you can always e-mail me with a direct link 
		to the artifact and I may be able to give some guidance. I can also give 
		you some tricks on how to compete with the professional buyers (a method 
		to saving money). Below are some links to websites that offer advice on 
		avoiding fakes. <u>Remember, use the dowsing rods.</u> They are an 
		excellent guide for what a person really needs. </span> <o:p></o:p>

		#1 – A person is not ready – this can be similar to visiting an ancient 
		site, it is just a matter of introduction. By this I mean assimilating 
		the artifact vibrational level. This vibrational level could be higher, 
		lower, or just different from yours. The best way is to give it time. 
		This could be a few days to a few months. I have artifacts that I have 
		just connected to after having them for a couple of years and this

		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">

		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">Dowsing is the best way to determine the right 
		artifacts to acquire. As outlined with the basic shamanic work there is 
		no room here for teaching dowsing as there are many sources for this 
		learning. I personally use two 90 degree wires (from coat hangers) with 
		two old ballpoint pen tubes as a holder. Use the factory cut end of the 
		tube as the upward rod shoulder. You can also use a pendulum but I find 
		it too slow as I need confirmation faster flipping through website pages 
		of artifacts. Before starting, state your confirmation on rod movement. 
		This is in the form of indicating what rod actions or directions will 
		indicate what is being communicated. By assigning different movements to 
		mean certain interpretations, clarity can be assured. Determine what 
		directions and movement mean; yes, no, future, past learning, great 
		benefits, and so on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left">
		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">By stating what movement indicates which answers are 
		being communicated, it eliminates all the confusion between you and the 
		rods. Generally, if rods move inward towards your chest that is a 
		conformation of Yes (pointing to you). If they <u>both</u> move outward 
		in opposite directions they are saying No (not part of you). If one 
		moves outward and the other follows in this direction it is showing the 
		connection the artifact has or is flowing to. Pointing to the left is 
		Past, to the right Future. One of the best ways to determine a copy is 
		to begin the session with the question: Is this one older than 1000 
		years, or 5000, or 10,000 years and so on. This method will also give 
		you a heads up on the culture with which you are dealing. After the time 
		period has been determined you can start with personal value. <u>
		Remember, general questions will produce general answers and general 
		results! <o:p></o:p>
