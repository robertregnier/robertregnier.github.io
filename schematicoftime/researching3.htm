		down to just a mere introduction. The second hurdle is I am not a writer 
		which is a bigger challenge in itself. The catalyst for this query into 
		ancient sites started years ago with a visit to one of them in a 
		Canadian provincial park. From this start I eventually found myself 
		wondering through Mayan pyramid sites and other ancient sites. Awestruck 
		by all the effort put into these sites one cannot help but ask, what 
		were the ancient shamans after when they built these magnificent

		The information below is a result of 18 years of Out of Body journeys 
		and Remote Viewing of ancient sites and their teachings. Surprisingly, 
		embedded in these teachings are insights into the deepest aspects of our 
		physical world, from the atomic level all the way to the universe’s 
		construction. The reason for this is the nature of the nonphysical 
		realms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span class="style5" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		As far as the material itself, the reader will quickly realize that not 
		only is this a difficult subject but it is little wonder that the 
		knowledge was lost over time. I tried to keep this book understandable 
		as possible with no complicated technical wording. Just simple diagrams 
		and photos, as much as possible for the information is for everyone. <o:p></o:p>

		Anyone that has seriously investigated any of the ancient sacred sites 
		knows that there was advanced knowledge being incorporated into these 
		places. This knowledge originated as teachings from thousands of years 
		of nonphysical communication by the shamans of the time. Then over the 
		millenniums this complex bed of information eroded down a few pieces of 
		the original teachings. By the time prehistoric people of 2500 years ago 
		came onto the scene there was nothing left but spiritual symbols or 
		mystery icons. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span class="style5" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		There was no need for alien intervention in the way some in our culture 
		understands it. There was also purpose and benefits that escapes modern 
		researchers. Massive amounts of labour were put into some of these sites 
		and it was not just to align to a impotent star or factitious sun god. 
		Nor were some of these sites landing strips for alien craft! <o:p></o:p>

		I think if you ran these modern scenarios past the ancient shamans they 
		would laugh rather than being intellectually insulted. The reason being 
		they had no need to defend that which comes from higher sources. It is 
		from these higher sources that one can still access this “database” 
		through OBEs and Remote Viewing. The information that the ancients 
		accessed is timeless and still available today as it was then. If 
		information about a particular site is required, that can also be done 
		by asking the individuals that built the sites. This can be accomplished 
		through their essence self and the energy that is still embedded in the 
		sites and artifacts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		As the messenger of this information it was difficult to narrow down the 
		complexities and the scope that this material covered. After 18 years of 
		Remote Viewing and Shamanic journeys into the nonphysical realms I have 
		accumulated thousands of pages of notes. Up to last year I was told to 
		keep this knowledge to myself, unless I could show the entire rage that 
		it encompassed. The amount of material made it impossible until a year 
		ago when I had an idea, and it was accepted. I asked if I could create a 
		“Readers Digest” of this topic, as long as all the subjects got 
		addressed. My teachers accepted this. Now the second challenge was 
		putting it into writing. As I said earlier; I am not a writer and I do 
		not have the resources for editing, so this book is nothing more than an 
		exposition of ancient knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		The bottom line is, this material is from nonphysical sources, as <u>I 
		have not added anything</u> into it that did not come from these ancient 
		sources (as with all information on this website). In fact after 
		receiving a teaching on any subject I would re-ask the same line of 
		questing a year or two later, just to test the answer for consistency (I

		Ancient shamanic art depicting the individual teachings, as it 
		demonstrates that the material is not new to humanity. It was forgotten 
		through time due to the secrecy of the shamanic world. Along with every 
		stage of the teachings I will try to show an example of this in nature, 
		by using astronomical images taken from various sources. Every object in 
		space is a time capsule of the universe’s structural process. The design 
		or structure of celestial objects are no different from that of the 
		atomic level. They are the same design only at different sizes and 
		stages of development. Each celestial object can show a different stage 
		of this development and are “snapshots” in time of how our physical 
		reality is structured. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		Along with the above examples I will also show more physical proof of 
		the teachings by providing Cymatics photos created by Hans Jenny. The 
		research that the late Hans Jenny did back in the 1960s was probably the 
		greatest scientific start in understanding how the universe was 
		structured. Adding to this is body of information is Walter Russell’s 
		work, which I recently discovered and was quite delighted to see how 
		much it parallels the teachings that I received. This is the practical 
		reason for introducing this research to the world. We need to look past 
		what “modern” science is overlooking and focus more into the true design 
		of the universe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		With the teachings from the “other side” or nonphysical realms greater 
		levels of energy development will be discovered. For the last hundred 
		years science has tinkered and tried to push the element world to find 
		the impossible, an unlimited source of energy. They will not find this 
		source in their current belief system as it is a nonphysical source 
		(that can be activated into the physical). In fact there have been 
		discoveries that point to this unlimited source of power but with no 
		prior understanding of what is being observed or how to replicate the 
		process, it remains a mystery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		Perception is far more dynamic than most people give it credit. We all 
		think that everyone sees and understands the way we do without realizing 
		there are 7 billion different perceptional levels on this planet. Some 
		are very similar to our own but most people outside our culture see 
		things through different belief systems then are own. One’s culture 
		being one of the most impressionable parts of how we see things and 
		interpret what we have just witnessed. The ancient peoples did not see 
		things the way modern people do and the only way to understand them 
		would be to become them. In other words the only way to understand 
		ancient sites is to ask the originators of the site. As said before this 
		can be accomplished through the nonphysical state as time has no 
		relevance on this level.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-fareast-language: EN-US">
		Even through this process the results fall under the filter system of 
		the one performing the inquiries. An example of this is channeling. Of 
		all the channelers out there I doubt that more than 1 or 2 are 
		proficient enough to be accurate to 75% of the information that is being 
		delivered through them. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-fareast-language: EN-US">
		Another example of this process is the angle of observation. If a 
		researcher is using an OBE (Out of Body Experience) or Remote Viewing to 
		do research, on say on the makeup of the universe there is still an 
		interpretation involved. This interpretation is reliant on what angle or 
		view of the completed system they are visualizing.&nbsp; Below is a 
		diagram demonstrating this. If your “filter system” is set up to only 
		see certain profiles of vibration then you will only see that level. 
		Everyone has different levels of vibration because that is what makes us 
		unique and it is these differences that break visions down into 
		interpretations. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-fareast-language: EN-US">
		In the diagram below; if a person is of a higher vibration and only 
		interested in higher vibrational levels of the universal structure then 
		that will be all that they see color (Red in the diagram). If that same 
		person focuses down into lower vibrational levels then they will start 
		to focus on the geometric aspects only (Blue). It also depends on the 
		levels a person can achieve and to what levels they are interested in. 
		To focus on all the levels one has to adjust their levels up and down to 
		see the entire picture.&nbsp;This is the reason I kept asking the same 
		question with gaps in time. Throughout the year and over years one 
		constantly shifts back and forth within their range of vibration. 
		Rechecking information is a good way to verify its consistency. <o:p></o:p>

		<p class="style8">“Each astral plane appears two-dimensional when its

		experienced when it is penetrated. The atmosphere above the plane, 
		surrounding the projector, is faintly color-tinted, as if consisting of 
		thin vapor radiating from the astral plane&#39;s surface. This color-tint is 
		not apparent when looking directly down upon the surface, but can be 
		seen misting all horizons. The corners of each square contain small but 
		distinct dots and splashes of color that look like yellow, green, 
		orange, and red paint. Each of these appears to be an entry point into a 
		specific internal realm or kingdom.”<o:p></o:p></p>

		structure. His drawing replicates the harmonic photos of Hans Jenny. The 
		central “flower” aspect also shows up in Jenny’s photos, to the right. 
		Understand that they are not the same vibration and thus will be 
		different in shape but you can see the flower’s depth and complexity.
