				Time cycles and the creation of physical realities through 
				angular energy awareness and structures have been part of many 
				ancient cultures knowledge, one of the most interesting being 
				the Maya. Many advanced cultures existed in the past along with 
				smaller knowledgeable shamanic groups that were spread around

				I have been shown how to connect to these learned ones and to

				perspective of time). This can be done, as it has been done this

				<span class="style7">Spanning thousands of years, many elite 
				shamans have created groups that work together in different time 
				continuums. In the past these gatherings were arranged at the 
				sacred sites where the site became the inter-dimensional 
				“boardrooms” for these advanced groups. Involving only the 
				advanced shamans, in their selected common modalities, they 
				became what are called on the “other side” <u>The Councils</u>. 
				These individual councils took place whether they were there in 
				the physical or not. Yearly astronomical cycle dates were used 
				only to herald the gatherings during the year regardless of 
				their geographical position or time period. The site’s alignment 
				assured the appropriate times and Energy Angles were available 
				(similar to telephone circuits) for the council’s sitting. This 
				was all regardless of thousands of miles, years of separation, 
				in an individual presence or in smaller groups. (This site 
				connection is far more complex and informative than there is 
				room for in this article.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

				The exception happens when the cyclic intervals of Earth’s 
				Progression create alignments that are askew to the energy 
				flows. In other words, the site’s angular position on Earth 
				would not be in alignment with the greater Energy Angles of the 
				Solar System or the Universe. At this point greater links into 
				time and space would be less efficient and clarity in 
				communication between the council members would be lost. <o:p></o:p>

				<span class="style7" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
				Council members or councils could also be made up of shamans 
				from one family group or DNA lineage. There were many different 
				types of sites and needs. This includes ancestral lineage links 
				to the past and future (each time period had an advanced shaman 
				to draw on). In some cultures this family link was the most 
				important creational thing in their reality. It was during these 
				intervals of Earth Progression that the sites needed to be 
				updated, or moved to the side a few degrees. Sometimes the angle 
				change was too great and a new pyramid or boulder arrangement 
				needed to be created. Usually canting the existing structure to 
				facilitate the angular flows of energy was all that was needed. 
				This canting can be seen inside Mayan pyramids as every 52 years 
				meant a new pyramid shell, but slightly to one side. The 
				separating cyclic “walls” of alignment are in 5000 year cycles 
				(with 2000 to 2500 year cycles on a different level in between) 
				in which time and space shift. Human DNA is directly affected by 
				this spiritually orchestrated cycle as is everything in this 
				reality, including Earth Shift Cycles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

				This is part of some very advanced teachings and is too 
				complicated for these pages as this is but an introduction. All 
				that needs to be said for now is that this knowledge will answer 
				many questions related to DNA, spirituality, evolution, and 
				culture connections. It is the same as out DNA but on a global 
				size in which an energetic grid layer sits over the Earth’s 
				surface and ratchets into many different structural shapes all 
				the way up the vibrational scale into nonphysical states. Time 
				and reality in the physical is related to this, be it our past, 
				present, and future. It is all explainable and in a way that can 
				be understood, but unfortunately this information will have to 
				wait until I find the resources. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
