		shamans know and realize, the more guides or “partners” you have in 
		“your council” the easier it becomes to get work done. This is a 
		learning process and one should not expect to see great results by just 
		grabbing a hundred artifacts and connecting to them. The fact is it will 
		work, but only when you are ready to hear the messages. For me, it has 
		been an 18 year process with the last 2 and half years working with 
		artifacts. One of the most powerful methods of acquiring groups is 
		through the Cache blades. These cache collections were used and created 
		by shamanic groups. These shamans understood where energy comes from and 
		how to harness it. This can be seen in their structures and pyramids, 
		which by the way has nothing to do with archeoastrology.

		By connecting to one artifact from a Cache Blade group you have 
		potential to connect to all of them in that group. This is a huge 
		subject that is better left for an article of its own. For now it is 
		enough to say that these blade caches also include votive offerings and 
		shrines, all of which are out of the reach of science and anyone not 
		working in the shamanic fields of understanding. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		A second way to gather group energies and more past contacts (and less 
		expensive) is to locate broken artifact collections. E-Bay is a good 
		source for this, at the bottom of the page is a link to these pages. 
		They can usually be purchased for a few dollars and their authenticity 
		is usually guaranteed simply because there is little profit in 
		replicating broken artifacts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		I’m aware of the archaeological field’s ethical stance on purchasing or 
		selling artifacts but there are research benefits that achieve levels of 
		information which would never come to light otherwise. Unfortunately if 
		we wait for archaeology, at its current evolutionary speed, it will 
		become its own study long before many answers are grasped. The “Clovis 
		First” concept is a great example of this. The truth is, in a matter of 
		hours a shaman can find many answers, but they will only count on the 
		levels of satisfaction. For me, this is enough, as statistical 
		information supplies an empty understanding and doesn’t truly feed ones 
		craving for knowledge. I know I will never live long enough to get the 
		answers that I really want without the shamanic method. The entire 
		ancient technological advanced civilizations of history were created 
		with this method, and it will endure all others means in the end. </span>

		As previously stated, there is no sense in repeating what others have 
		taught on shamanism, but there is a need to move into a new and modern 
		level of understanding. This does not replace or contradict the old 
		teachings and the belief systems associated with shamanism. What is 
		needed is a new modern practise and methods that are not wrapped around 
		thousands of years of superstition, fear, and general misconceptions, 
		never mind all the cultural clutter that has accumulated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

		A final note; the artifact method usually requires more than just one 
		artifact. This is because their individual energies need to co-create 
		with your consciousness. So you will get ones that are story tellers 
		(the ones with the information) and others that act as “go betweens” – 
		between your consciousness and the “past one’s consciousness”. These “in 
		between ones” are called the<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> 
		“Communicators and Interpreters” </b>for they are the most important and 
		are a required tool for all of this to work. Communicators also called 
		Teachers and Interpreters are the translators and both are the “path” 
		and the “Bridge”. As you begin working with artifacts you will soon 
		realize that some have the ability to connect to consciousness quite 
		different than your own. These special artifacts (created by the hands 
		of aviator level people) can translate different levels of consciousness 
		into modern thought patterns and understandings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		It is a misconception to think all humans today think in the same 
		matter. It is even more pronounced going back thousands of years from 
		now. This is the main barrier for many intuitive people, as a thought 
		may have many different concepts and meanings behind it. True 
		Communicators and Translators will find you as all teachers become 
		available when the student is ready. There are many pages of 
		understandings and experiences that I would like to relay to you about 
		this subject but I believe separate sections will be necessary. <o:p></o:p>
