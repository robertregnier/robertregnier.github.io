		balancing (present with the past). I have performed the general duties 
		of a shaman including the healing arts and teaching workshops, but these 
		traditional roles have been substituted by my interest in pure research. 
		This new field of shamanic research was initiated by the new tools and 
		methods that I had acquired over the past few years. Generally, I am 
		interested in finding answers to questions science alone will never be 
		capable of acquiring. Along with the general shamanic practises, I have 
		found a very complementary tool called Remote Viewing (a 14 year 
		practise) which is limitless in its abilities. From the structure of an 
		atom to journeying outside the known universe there is absolutely no 
		limit. The boundaries are found only in one’s desire and within the 
		amount of time spent practicing the skill. Although the years of 
		experience in the healing arts as a Reiki Master and facilitator of 
		Dimensional Healing (a higher vibrational modality than Reiki) I still 
		find more excitement in discovery than in rebalancing energies. In my

		because there are few opportunities to make a living and raise a family. 
		Decades ago, I came to the conclusion that it didn’t matter what level 
		one achieves in the field there would never be answers to important 
		questions such as who was part of North American’s first migrants. One 
		of the main reasons for this is that most of the oldest sites are under 
		coastal waters. Aside from that there are problems with academic 
		understandings on where to look for these old sites, as they will not 
		fit into conventional profiles. A few years ago I found myself 
		frustrated with the slowness of discovery and the politics that hid 
		information that was needed. My inquiring mind needed to know, but the 
		truth is it will take many generations of field archaeologist to unravel
