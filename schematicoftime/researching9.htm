		also be off to the side of specific sites due to placement in time 
		(during different time periods of development). The sites would have

		grids migrate, like all structural components they are in motion. Once 
		the grid migrated off to the side the site would start to lose its

		Octahedron grids (diamond) all the way to Dodecahedron (Six side 
		slices). Each of these geometric grids will have their own vibrational

		People who study the sites have observed that around the world there are 
		common angular positions or directions that the sites would be aligned 
		to. Also noted was that a group of sites on one side of the planet would 
		be aligned in the same angular direction as a completely different site, 
		on the other side of the globe. Both groups of sites could not be 
		visually seeing the same star or planet configuration regardless of the 
		time of day. How then could this be possibly be related to individual 
		constellations or an astronomical point? They can’t but there are other 
		reason for alignments in common directions. Some of the common 
		directions noted around the world are; 12 to19.5 degrees, 52 to 54.5, 
		and 110 to135 degrees. In the Manitoba Whiteshell area, archeologists 
		have for years noticed that the ancient Petroforms (rock mosaics) were 
		aligned at 53.5 degrees. It puzzled them as they scrambled to relate it 
		to something. The sun, moon, and stars had to be the answer, but there 
		was never any valid association found. <o:p></o:p></p>

		In other places the researchers noticed very accurate planning of the

		civilization purposely building on a slant to the other structures on

		When it comes to these power points on the earth’s surface I will not 
		show what can be accomplished or what angles are the most productive or 
		powerful. This is because in the wrong hands some could take advantage 
		of this power and use it over others. Another reason is that this 
		information is very specific to individuals and their levels of 
		awareness. A person may think they are working in a sacred site for a 
		certain corporeal desire without realizing that their higher aspects 
		have another agenda at heart. This can lead to confusion or the 
		conclusion, from an intellectual level, creating disappointment that one 
		does not see the results that were expected. There are also times that 
		energetic results can be so subtle that association to the site is not 
		recognized. This is because the connection and the follow up work was 
		accomplished from higher vibratory levels, and more than likely having 
		their effects many days after the visit to the site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
