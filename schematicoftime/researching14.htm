		Time cones are another level of understanding time. Unfortunately the 
		complexity is too difficult to show fully with two dimensional diagrams. 
		Below is the most basic view I was shown of this aspect. As you recall 
		the 8 pack has 6 vortex entry or exit points created by the internal 8 
		spheres. The axis and the event horizon fall within the center of these 
		spiraling ribbons of energy flow. In the physical level, this would be 
		seen occurring at the 45 degree axis and its entry and exit points (at 
		the cube corners). This ribbon of spiraling energy also creates funnel 
		shaped vortices called “Time Cones”. I was shown that these main 45 
		degree time cones are also divided up into different rates of time. 
		These different rates of time depend on the cones position, in reference 
		to flow direction and proximity to higher or lower vibrational 
		influences or axis. <o:p></o:p></p>

		The speed of time allows energy to move at a scale that is acceptable 
		for all that exist in their individual realities. All that exists in 
		this physical creation is a product of consciousness, on one level or 
		another. Therefore consciousness has power over time for it alone 
		dictates the creation and the speed of individual creations. Time is not 
		singular in form nor is it a singular duration throughout the universe. 
		There are multitudes of different time realities in this universe, for 
		everything that exists will have its own timeframe and its own awareness 
		or need for this framework. Therefore every reality will have its own 
		timeframe or placement in the scale of universal framework. These scaled 
		time realities are only relevant to the creators of them and to some 
		extent those that co-create with the observer. Co-creations allow 
		different conscious levels and sources to assimilate with one another 
		for the purpose of creating realities within a common vibration. It is 
		in this manner that consciousness has dominance over its environment or 
		plane of existence. Each vibrational plane will have its own spectrum of 
		vibrations but it will always be within the limits of that plane’s 
		capacity. The choice of consciousness is; which level is desired for the 
		best creation, and from there adapting a level of its consciousness to 
		the vibration of this level. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		If we look towards science for answers to this perplexing question we 
		will find that they will not achieve the answers unless they abandon 
		their current traditional beliefs. Their current understandings will 
		have to graduate to higher state of awareness. One of the first and 
		probably the biggest steps in this understanding is that our universe 
		does not have one time frame, nor do the indivi<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">d</i>ual 
		suns and planets that inhabit it. The universe is continually being 
		created; it is by no means an uncontrolled explosion from one beginning 
		point. Matter forms and can form instantly anywhere, all at once, or in 
		separate time frames. In fact the universe is expanding in all 
		directions including inwards and these expansions are in complexity of 
		design. There are many dimensions in this universe as well there are 
		many universes. The big bang did not occur but there was a similar 
		beginning as far as the universe being created all at once. There are 
		also more than this one universe and there will be more to come. The 
		concept that the universe is expanding into empty space is incorrect for 
		there is no empty space. Empty space implies that there is room 
		unfilled, but room in what unfilled aspect or void? If empty space was 
		desired what created the empty space in the first place, and were does 
		it reside or does it need to? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		The truth is that empty space is only that which cannot be detected by 
		our three dimensional instruments (refers back to the earlier Seth 
		comment). The exciting part in all of this is that our three dimensional 
		level is an extremely small component of all that exists.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

		We have all seen moments that have gone in a flash only to experience a 
		similar moment that appears to last much longer. What we don’t know is 
		that it is controllable and it is done through consciousness. In balance 
		or out of balance we create more or less time flow, for time is an 
		expression of balance over an opposite flow. Therefore time is a 
		measurement of flow rate. Moving the energy of experience with less 
		restriction will create the appearance of faster time rate. An older

		The structure and the workings of this structure dictate how time moves 
		and cycles. Time is cyclic and there are many different “sizes” to these 
		cycles. The ancient Mayans were the historic masters of this 
		understanding. Unfortunately their understanding was lost until now. 
		Knowing how time works within its structure is the key to understanding 
		possible time travel and creation itself. The cycles account for 
		everything including the DNA of species, elements, and even our personal 
		day. You can measure time by observing the size of cycle that is in 
		progress. This also applies to larger cycles that our sun and distance 
		stars are caught in. The Maya understood that it was all related, for 
		everything has a cycle and comparing with each movement a system of 
		reference could be established. What is happening cyclically in the 
		solar movements can be applied on smaller scales here on earth. The 
		ancient Maya knew this and understood the process as demonstrated in 
		their complex “calendars”. Astrology addresses a small part of this 
		pattern but there is much more to it than understood. There is a 
		“clockwork” mechanism at work due the universal flow and structure but 
		most of the “workings” are hidden from our senses. Predictions of 
		probabilities can be observed, as far as knowing where and when change 
		will take place. The type of change can also be determined due to the 
		next “String” or energy flow in the ratcheted movement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		assigned energy patterns called matter. In some respects elements and 
		matter did not exist prior to this co creative organization. As humans 
		we are not only creating our own physical bodies but are also 
		manifesting and grouping together with other levels of consciousness to 
		create this reality or world. Earth based creations have and will always 
		exist whether humans are involved or not so I’m not saying that other

		determines creation and it is through the filtered perception of 
		consciousness that organization happens. One other thing for now; for 
		our level of consciousness to inhabit any reality there must be 
		acceptance by the other levels of consciousness. This happens through a

		Space as well as physical form is a creation of consciousness that 
		organizes the reality into a format of prearranged perceptible 
		templates. These templates have been prearranged at other levels of 
		nonphysical vibration by higher levels that have the need to experience 
		the denser realities. All levels of consciousness whether it is from the 
		lowest vibration to the highest can within limited parts create the 
		environment we call the physical world. The “conscious levels” of 
		individual earth elements will co-create with higher vibratory states 
		like our source consciousness. Their proximity to source energy is their 
		strength and this strength of energy flow creates a longer “time 
		duration” due to slower vibratory rate of this source energy. In this 
		reality that translates to a common vibratory index called the Earth. 
		All environments are a balance (to a certain extent) of energy flows 
		from different entry points or directions. Energy flows are a result of 
		conscious needs and this need can be weak or strong in desire. As the 
		need is resolved (a balanced state) the creational energies that make up 
		the environment start to break up or dissolve. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		This dissembling of the creation is a special aspect of time “ending”. 
		We see and understand it as historic endings, whether it is earth’s 
		history or just a moment in our personal day. The duration period of 
		matter or physical reality is determined by the vibratory level, 
		strength of connection, and the source energy itself. Physical matter is 
		a creation of unbalanced energies so the level of imbalance it will 
		determine the type of matter. This process is also in relevance to the 
		time aspect. Like a glass of water tipping over, it will change its 
		shape as in time it finally reached empty.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

		If you co-create with “natural” material like rock you will achieve a 
		longer lasting creation due to its purer form or direct connection to 
		lower source energy. Wood on the other hand was created from the same 
		elements of nature but its creation was instrumented by the tree’s 
		consciousness and this is a “type of filter” from source energy. The 
		co-creation of the tree’s consciousness with the elements will be a 
		relationship of energies that will determine the time frame of the 
		tree’s needs, thus the wood’s existence. Even after the tree‘s 
		consciousness has left the reality other forms of consciousness like 
		bacteria and fungus will bring about another creation that can 
		accelerate or impede the speed of the time frame. Adding a third aspect 
		energy like human desire will also change the original energy in a 
		subtended aspect that could appear as if the tree’s force is still 
		present. As you can see time in this scenario is all about the speed of 
		each creational need that is present. Time appears to overlap but as far 
		as the original tree is concerned it ended at its death. <o:p></o:p>

		You may say why does wood in a desert not disintegrate as fast as wood 
		in a humid environment? It is because there is a forth aspect involved 
		here that is separate but still one in the same. The environment, or in 
		this case Earth will have its own laws of creation of its own time 
		frames. It has its own co creative order and flow of energies. These 
		energies are specific to its structure. In this structure there will be 
		areas of more energy flow and areas of almost neutral or no energy flow. 
		Placement in this larger creation will have an effect because of “time” 
		differentiations in the larger cycle or environmental energy flows. The 
		earth itself is a co creation of different environments that allow for 
		different time periods to develop. Thus desert or dry areas appear to be

		It doesn’t project itself onto matter but co creates and organizes with 
		other forms. Together, they become allies that are defused throughout 
		the reality being created. This creative consciousness is not imprisoned 
		into its creation but has only a part of it there to maintain the 
		creation. If a human “soul” energy could incarnate into a physical 
		reality it probably would explode this realities’ structure due to the 
		imbalance of too much energy (as humans we only require 3 -5 % of our 
		soul’s energy).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p>

		There is nothing in the current scientific understandings that will help 
		you understand what time is. This is why we have to start from the 
		beginning. The only concepts of time in our modern world have come from 
		intellect and imagination. Although there is nothing wrong with this 
		process there can be a problem with the information being very limited 
		in its scope. If human intellect had “designed” the universe you can bet 
		it also would be completely flawed in more than just concept. All 
		current understandings of time have come from scientific theories. These 
		are theories and are based on understandings that have no or very little 
		truth behind them. Most of our scientific understandings originate from 
		incorrect ideas created decades and even centuries ago. It is from these 
		inaccurate concepts of the natural world that current science continues 
		to carry the torch, but with increased difficulty. To understand time 
		you would first have to understand the design of the universe. Even with 
		our current technology and computer sciences we are still in a very 
		primitive state as far as addressing these major subjects. <o:p></o:p>

		How does one find the answers to the questions of time, universal 
		design, and the creation of reality? In the past we created religions 
		based on mystic’s journeys into the non physical realities. 
		Unfortunately interpretations of these journeys were subjective as to 
		the level of awareness and knowledge of the mystics themselves. Even with 
		good understandings by advanced mystics, the people that followed their 
		teachings usually distorted or altered the information over time, for one reason or 
		another. This leaves us with the field of science but again modern 
		science is based on many problematic theories that are all based on 
		intellect only. At any given time period in scientific history the truth 
		becomes dated as new instruments prove that the theory was flawed. This 
		will continues unfortunately with no end in sight simply because tools 
		and mathematics based in one reality cannot bridge the other realities. <o:p></o:p>

		It was pointed out to me that reality is an illusion and this illusion 
		can be likened to a mirage. How can an object caught in a mirage 
		understand or investigate what is creating the illusion in the first 
		place? There is only one way, we must remove ourselves from the illusion 
		itself. It sounds too simple but it has been done countless times in the 
		past so what has divorced us from this ability in modern times? Almost 
		everyone knows the answer to the last question (we cut ourselves off 
		from source) but the real question is how can we recover the past 
		knowledge and the methods? <o:p></o:p></p>

		First of all, if you do not understand the energy flow that supports and 
		creates the physical world you will not know why it appears the way it 
		does. Energy always has a source and every source has its flavor or 
		vibrational resonance. It is in the structural design of the universe 
		that decides the type of energy that is accessible and in what amounts 
		are available. All future technology will be designed under this 
		knowledge. All future scientists will have complete concepts to design 
		their technology. If you do not know where to look you will not find 
		what you seek. You could be standing on the truth only to find that your 
		elevated position comes from the structure you are standing on. 
		Understanding the structure of reality can be very simple if taken one 
		piece at a time. Furthermore, all of us have the ability to access the 
		universal knowledge. It is just a matter of acknowledging this ability 
		and then doing something about it. Some simple axioms that can be 
		applied; <o:p></o:p></p>

		observe our “time creations” moving in different rates or speeds without

		experiences of survival. Notice the common theme of fear. So why does

		the motivator. Thoughts are projections but emotion is the impetus or 
		driving force behind them. Fear has the ability to etch its memory into 
		our minds at “basic life” levels (it is ingrained from our primal past). 
		Blissful moments or expressions of passion can also show the time effect 
		but they are not as noticeable. We are programmed to see fear with pain 
		and bliss as the reward so fear becomes the base need before any added 
		experience can be gifted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
		Blissful and passionate moments generally have opposite effect on time 
		by speeding up the rate. As we have all observed in moments that we are 
		enjoying ourselves time seems to slip away very quickly. So what is the 
		separator between the emotional speeds of time? It can be found in the 
		vibration or frequency of the conscious expression itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

		Fear can maintain a grip on this reality and this in itself would make 
		time appear slower (for the observer). The base root of the emotion 
		called fear is a perceptional view of one’s surroundings based on lower 
		levels of understanding. Lower being a reference to a lower vibrational 
		state or reality. As discussed many times in “The Schematic of God” the 
		vibrational level (physical, physiologically, or nonphysical) will only 
		support that like vibration that defines the state’s level. The 
		frequency rate or vibrational level is the aptitude of the level and 
		fear as we all know is very dense in nature no matter where it is found. <o:p></o:p>

		Emotions transcend all levels to a certain extent but on higher levels 
		(balanced states) this type of emotion would just be observed. In lower 
		states it is experienced, in other words lower levels support the 
		experience of fear. Fear has a certain ability to lock the expression 
		into slower time frames (but only in lower levels). Lower levels are 
		denser and thus move slower (in perspective of being viewed from a 
		higher state). <o:p></o:p></p>

		As I have already said we exist as consciousness in a thought responsive 
		universe. This also applies to nonphysical realities. As explained in 
		the chapter “In the Beginning” – “The Schematic of God” thought was the 
		source creation of this universe (from Source Power). Thought or desire 
		manifests creation on all levels but as you approach this reality 
		physical forms begin to manifest but in vibrational levels that are 
		still observable to us. As you continue to get closer to this reality 
		you are essentially immersing yourself (as consciousness) into denser 
		vibrational fields. In other words the manifested forms become more 
		physical as they enter into denser regions called “Orb Shells”</span><span class="style3" style="font-size: 8.0pt; line-height: 115%;">©</span><span class="style15" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"> 
		and we usually see these manifestations in our peripheral vision. In 
		this level they will appear as semi physical, some people call them 
		ghosts or spirits. This is not necessarily true by definition for there 
		is much more to this. Descending further into the vibrational density, 
		thought forms become perceptible and are called physical. The physical 
		reality is a composite of vibrations, that exist within a zone we call 
		reality. This zone is made up of many different layers of energy thought 
		forms that are perceptible simply because they have some common 
		vibrational needs with us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		On a radio dial many stations can be separated by a simple devise known 
		as a variable potentiometer. All this devise does is separate the radio 
		band into segments. Radio stations then broadcast on these individual 
		segments. We all accept this concept but to say that there are many 
		realities within this reality is too much for most people to accept. It 
		is the truth for there is a turner and it too uses frequencies to 
		separate the physical realities from one another. Science will someday 
		develop this understanding but only after developing a tool to show 
		them. We don’t need this tool for we are ready posses the ability and it 
		is called consciousness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p>

		Time is also a component of what separates realities or dimensions. 
		Using a clock to measures time would prove inadequate for the clock has 
		its own vibrational filed and this is also relevant to the observer’s 
		creation. Using the movie model the clock would be one actor and the 
		person partaking in the experience would be another. Unfortunately the 
		two actors are from two different movies and are now co-creating a third 
		movie. It could be likened in difference to an actor from a horror movie 
		now co acting with an actor from a love story. Their obvious vibrational 
		rolls will be very different but yet they can still co-create together,

		The clock was not assembled with or in any specific vibrational level

		than the emotion of fear of the human. The speed of time is the 
		measurement of events in sequence, but the sequence must correspond with 
		the vibrational levels of the creating parts. As discussed vibration can 
		co-create to certain extends with other vibrational levels and create a 
		sequence of events called time or reality. Base element consciousness 
		cannot exceed its level of creation but it can join the human in form by 
		allowing human creation to form it into a different shape. It is no

		These levels are supported by slower vibrations that cannot create

		its own specific vibration, a vibration that cannot be changed. The

		There is a difference between rate or speed and vibration. Rate is a

		and creates all individual forms. The preverbal rotating fan blade 
		example is a good model for it can move at a faster rate but this 
		doesn’t mean it has changed its original vibration. It is merely 
		repeating its vibrational level through a patterned repetition (in a 
		closer sequence).It is in the eye of the beholder that determines what

		In order to effect the environment on earth one needs to project outward 
		at a different perceptional frequencies than the world itself. This can 
		be accomplished by first raising ones vibration and expanding this 
		vibration outward, not inward, and always to a supportive reality. In 
		other words a person is adjusting their reality to an inner state of 
		vibration. Reality in any dimension is a projection of one’s state of 
		emotions and beliefs. It is the emotional perception and projection of 
		corresponding vibratory “speed” or “rate” that will determine the visual 
		correspondence with the reality. Being placed into a fearful place has 
		the same effect of appearing to last forever. People living in fear do 
		not move for they are “frozen in time”. Love and excitement on the 
		opposite side of the scale will show the same time effects but at a 
		faster time frame, this too is all relevant to the observer and their 
		experience. Trying to measure emotion is like an attempt to measure

		There are two ways that an individual can slow down perceived time. One

		within their level. In affect there is no separation between the two for 
		a balanced state is a higher vibration within any level. A balanced 
		state also allows one to connect with higher level energies which in

		The difference between the physical reality and those of higher or lower 
		vibrational states is that the physical reality is a very narrow 
		“shell”. Nonphysical dimensional levels are extremely expansive in

		a localized vibrational state when compared with other dimensional 
		levels. This region of focused energy creates bands of existence that 
		must be maintained and supplied with consistent flow of energy. Take any

		One final comment on fear and its creative experiences. In a ``life threatening`` experience it is the event itself that is the “need”. In ``life threatening`` experiences there is a goal that is being attempted. The purpose of the event is to achieve change or movement in a person’s life. This is a design that comes from higher levels than the person’s physical awareness. In the case of an individual’s “need” the physical awareness is more than likely stuck in its growth or evolution. To bring it out of this stagnate state, a shock method is sometimes required. This means that higher aware levels of the individual motivate the unaware physical form into situations of attention. Not much different than a Zen master getting some attention from a pupil by using a tingsha. When a 
		person finds themselves in this situation they are not only connected to 
		a higher level but are being immersed in this higher vibration. At the 
		moment of immersion the higher frequency gives us the ability to see the 
		physical reality in a slower rate by default</span><span class="style3" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-themecolor: text1">.

		Consciousness is a band of energy that can be found in layers just like 
		the vibrational “Shells” mentioned previously. They are layered because 
		of common vibration; this includes desire, intelligence, and the 
		emotional quotients. Layering occurs after thought has arisen; from 
		there it naturally pools or gravitates into common arenas of the matrix 
		of all sentient beings. Exchanges of thought and information as well as 
		experiences can be tapped into at these regions. This banding is and 
		does overlap realities in all levels. The difference is that individual 
		realties are only capable of intersecting or tapping into that which is 
		of common reach into their vibrational fields. You can, in your reality, 
		extend out into the higher or lower bands by raising or lowering your 
		vibration to the level of choice. </span>

		Tapping into original and unrealized (for Earth based realities) music, art, invention is achieved this way. Start by 
		finding the common desire and intent of your emotional field. Follow it 
		up or down <u>after connection is secured</u>. Once a vibrational shift has 
		been felt – Let Go, and absorb the background energy! This will lead you 
		to the information you seek. You can ask for help in the learning stages 
		for there are many that would love to assist. Everyone understands 
		evolution of spirit! <o:p></o:p></p>

		My first introduction into the question of space was a few years ago 
		during a journey into the etheric realties. The notes below might not 
		appear exceptional but this experience was mind blowing. Most of these 
		experiences into these levels are imposable to translate………I guess you

		In this journey I asked the question; what is space? Immediately after 
		asking this question I found myself at the edge of an endless meadow that 
		was banked by forest on each side. As I stood there I started to focus 
		into the scene and then realized that I could see the life cycles of the 
		different plants. The grasses, shrubs, and weeds all displayed their 
		lives from start to end and in the time it takes to create this form in 
		the physical. It was obvious I was in a higher vibrational state then 
		possible in real life for I saw all of this at once and in complete ways 
		that defy explanation. From here I was told that space and life are 
		perceptions of cycles. The cycle of one life and the time it take to 
		complete it, was one perceptive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span class="style15" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		The comparison could be shown by walking across this meadow; it would 
		(in my mind) take “this long”. Obviously if I drove a vehicle across it 
		would be shorter. Space is as simple as that, a perception of time that 
		it takes to cross a given point of observation to another point where 
		this observation is complete. In other words it is all relative to the 
		life span and scope of the life form that is in motion or observation. <o:p></o:p>

		Space now becomes a form within itself as it now occupies consciousness. 
		Encased in consciousness, space gives way to form and the creation of this 
		form. Space is now form and consciousness is the parameters of this 
		dimension of reality. Reality is now dimension of consciousness and the 
		form becomes the space of a given form. There is no limit to the amount 
		of conscious effort, and it will have a direct proportion to the size of 
		form. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
