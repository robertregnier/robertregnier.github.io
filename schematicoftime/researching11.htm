		believe ancient shamanic groups not only discovered this but also 
		understood the significance of it. This came about during their work at 
		sacred sites (vortex areas). The main advantage in a vortex area is the 
		timeless aspect of it. These spots have direct connections to multi 
		dimensional aspects and shortcut the time required to witness the 
		results. With this realization structures were built to harness and 
		focus the energy much like a magnifying glass focuses light. <o:p></o:p>

		A quick explanation of how this works starts with the lattice’s null 
		energy (static background) is balanced so close to zero that it could be 
		said that it is at a zero energy state. Each individual harmonic 
		cube/cell has a tremendous amount of power, but this power is balanced 
		out by an opposite polarity cube/cell beside it. This balance of power 
		between adjacent cells nulls out the apparent potential, so that it 
		appears invisible to us. In all parts of the structure the balance is 
		achieved from opposite flows of the same “strength”. Therefore, the 
		energy appears to be zero. It&#39;s when the lattice is deliberately 
		unbalanced that you really get to see the power. It takes very little to 
		unbalance the null or balance to produce a tremendous amount of free 
		energy. These opposite energy &quot;attributes&quot; that create the null are 
		polarized energies. They are almost mirror images of one another, and 
		they together create a quiet zero null. This is part of the balance of 
		the universe and is everywhere including here on Earth. To release this 
		background energy from the lattice one needs to manipulating plasma with 
		magnetics. I will show more of this in the future.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

		One of the most important aspect of sacred sites are their ability to 
		transcend time and space. The “veils” of time and space in these special 
		areas are very thin because geometries are compacted very close together. This 
		chapter is a brief look at what is going on and how it fits into the 
		Universal Structure and ancient sites. This is important if you are 
		designing a site as it needs these specific connections. As you know the 
		spheres are a composite of moving energies and flow patterns are created 
		by the structure itself. As described in the earlier chapters the axis 
		and horizontal flows divide the sphere into its pattern of flow. On the 
		outer perimeters of a sphere this flow becomes a multi-shelled flow of 
		opposite helixes (known as strings) which position themselves as 
		ribbons, but in separate layers. When I Remote Viewed this surface 
		structure it reminded me of a ball of twine with one string beside

		cycle). This interaction is felt again (in comparison) after the

		The energy must travel through its course as it completes a cycle around 
		sphere’s circumference (shown above with the red and blue lines “B”). 
		These energy strings are also “time strings” of consciousness that end 
		after the cycle is finished. They end as the string flow shifts into the 
		next harmonic stage (a string beside them, in the ribbon “C”). Each 
		string in a ribbon is adjacent to one that is lower or higher in 
		vibrational rate and continues in this harmonic scale throughout the 
		ribbon.

		This could be compared to how a train shifts onto another track. The new 
		cycle, of the same energy movement, now travels around and through the 
		sphere to complete its cycle (sphere #1, 2, 3 in “C” above). This new 
		cycle will be a different vibratory level than the prior one. It could 
		be higher or lower in vibration, all depending of the direction taken 
		within the main structure. This system works on all levels of 
		consciousness and its creations including our lives, past and present. 
		To rewind this path and go back into one’s lifetime would be impossible, 
		for journeying back into the string’s path would or could switch you 
		into a new past reality. This could even be a past reality you never 
		lived, but it is within you capacity, and thus part of you. If this was 
		outside your present awareness lifetime you would never know if you did live it, 
		or whether it was even a probability in your couscous level, at that 
		time. Going back in time would be a generality and would be more 
		accurate viewed from larger earth cycles. These switches in time are 
		known as a “Forks in the Road”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		You can see how this journey would be a stretch, for this reality is 
		based on others that are here with you now and with their realities 
		(their journeys) linked to your present experience. Going back into 
		earth’s history would be going back into other’s co-creations, but at 
		what level and with which ones. To go back into earth’s past would be an 
		adventure into different spiritual sources and their levels. This would 
		be equivalent to entering any unknown reality anywhere! <o:p></o:p>
