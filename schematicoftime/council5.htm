		personal introduction to these methods started over nine years ago at 
		two sacred sites in Manitoba, Canada called; Bannock Point and Tie 
		Creek. The artifact method was introduced to me only two and a half 
		years ago but most of my prior training was already in place for this 
		new level. Without having this prior training the most important part of 
		this work is just the desire to know and the need to understand. In my 
		case it was the need to know more of our prehistoric North American 
		cultures, but this has branched out to a global interest now.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

		The artifact teaching level started with a visit to a local museum that 
		housed many original West Coast totem poles. I was drawn there with a 
		nagging feeling to spend some time with them, and this I did. That night 
		I did a Remote Viewing/OBE session and found my living room full of 
		people from the past (the ones associated with that day’s totem poles). 
		It was from their presence and obvious support that the spiritual 
		energies of the last hundred and fifty years presented to me the bridge 
		I needed to access even further into the past. From that point, (with 
		their assistance) I could go back a few thousand years by just holding 
		an ancient artifact of the time period. After a few sessions, I quickly 
		realized that there was a limit and I found it at 5000 years B.P. 
		(Before Present). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		It turns out that time cycles have barriers within specific periods, 
		major ones reoccur at 5000 year increments. These are called “Time 
		Barriers” and again I needed an older bridge if I wanted to go beyond 
		this 5000 year cycle of time. The bridges exist as a result of Earth 
		reality shifts that create different Earth reality shells (see the 
		Schematic of God for introduction to shells). There is no room here for 
		further explanation on the structure of time, for now it just needs to 
		be mentioned that barriers exist and they can be reached.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		To reach past major time barriers you need an artifact from the “other 
		side” of the time barrier. In other words, to go past 5,000 years you 
		need an artifact that is at least 5,100 years old. If it is of a good 
		energetic quality, it will take you back up to 10,000 years. Again, to 
		get past this barrier you will need something from at least 10,100 year 
		and older. Every increment of 5,000 years needs to be bridged. There are 
		smaller increments inside each 5,000 years, but they are not as 
		formidable as the larger time cycles. Currently my oldest artifact is 
		300,000 years or older and from Eastern Europe which brings me into a 
		global search for the past. I’m also attempting to keep it within the 
		current “modern” human families. From what I can pick up, to go into 
		Neanderthal and older Hominid groups would mean bridging DNA genetic 
		conscious barriers (maybe in the future). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		I say this with confidence from working experience with different 
		subspecies of humans in prehistoric North America alone. There were five 
		main families of people that migrated to North and <st1:place
w:st="on">South America</st1:place>. They each have their own distinct level of 
		consciousness that needs to be bridged. In other words, it took a few 
		artifacts to accomplish this. All this work needs to be done on ones own 
		as there are no museums that would allow this type of research on their 
		precious collections (typically hidden in basement storages).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
