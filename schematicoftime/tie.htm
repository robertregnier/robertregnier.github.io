		my shamanic journeys researching the Tie Creek Site I have been told 
		that this site is one of the most powerful places on the planet. The 
		power lies in its multidimensional abilities and the properties that 
		allow connections to all these levels. Along with this statement was the 
		comment; if proof is needed the answer lies in the fact that it stands 
		in the heart of North America and no one is aware of its existence. This 
		can be shown in the fact that more than 99 percent of the resident 
		population of Manitoba (1.2 million) have never heard of it, and its in 
		their “back yard”. In other words the vibration level of the site is so 
		uncommon that it is just outside of most people’s awareness level. <o:p></o:p>

		<span lang="EN-CA" style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;" class="style10"><span class="style6">Just 
		think about this for a moment. If the vibration of a sacred site is of 
		common frequency to the general public it is well recognized and known, 
		as can be seen in many sites around the world. Tie Creek was discovered 
		in 1935 and is still virtually unknown today. There are other reasons 
		for this including archaeologists that want it kept quiet and a 
		nonphysical guardian with little patience for disturbances.</span><span class="style6" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

		<span lang="EN-CA" style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;" class="style10"><span class="style6">Similar 
		to most of the ancient “geometric” sites around the world <u>they were 
		not built for astronomical alignments</u> but were built for the purpose 
		of energetic alignments. The placements of the sites were not chosen, 
		but were shown to shamans that were interested in that earth location&#39;s 
		strength and abilities. None of these sites were created with 
		intellectual astronomical needs. They were created to operate as tools 
		for shamanic purposes and avenues. There is no value from the site for 
		any that are not working with these energies. Yes, there were different 
		cultures that came upon the sites years later and used them for their 
		own political or religious advantages. That does not mean the site was 
		designed for that cult, but only modified by them.</span><span class="style6" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

		powerful sites are ones that have been recognized for their abilities as 
		each site has its own “forte”. These spots or points of reference are 
		situated all around the planet and are energetic flows or currents of 
		energy that support the physical reality we call Earth. At these 
		locations (some call them vortex portals) many different vibrational 
		levels and abilities can be accessed, and with very little effort. To 
		trained shamans this is a huge advantage over and above their own 
		abilities, as it allows an enhanced personal ability to connect to 
		levels never achieved before. Each site will have its own specific 
		energetic profile that can be recognized and utilized. This efficiency 
		can be in the direction for healing, social bonding, research, contact 
		with other forms of consciousness, and so on. This is where the UFO 
		contact comes into play.</span><span class="style6" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span class="style4" lang="EN-CA" style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The Power Sites are an 
		attractant for humans and all kinds of physical and nonphysical 
		entities. This includes what we have in this modern culture deemed as 
		aliens. In truth there is no such thing as an alien if you look from the 
		bigger picture, this includes our own spiritual origins. <o:p></o:p>

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span class="style4" lang="EN-CA" style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Our souls have had many lives 
		as Earth bound humans and many lives in other realities as different 
		life forms that we would call alien, from our current position. As such, 
		the UFO appearing on the same opening moments of my first visit to Tie 
		Creek was no accidental occurrence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="EN-CA" style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;" class="style10"><span class="style6">UFOs and 
		other strange phenomena are a offshoot product of these energetic spots 
		or areas, even if the area is not recognized with any human markers. 
		Although these areas could be mapped out, it would require a four 
		dimensional map. The reason for this is the map would have to correspond 
		to different human perceptional levels and the levels of the nonphysical 
		entities involved. It is not that the spots generate these strange 
		occurrences but it is that they allow the many different realities to 
		cross paths, within our <u>Perceptional Reality</u>. These spots have 
		historically been recognized, as seen in Europe, with ancient stone 
		works being dismantled and replaced with Christian churches. It has 
		always been in people’s nature to gravitate towards these areas and 
		recognize their power on one level or another. Upon reaching one of 
		these spots the interpretation can be felt in their silence, energy, or 
		time altering ability. It would serve science well if they could 
		understand this and try some of their more exotic experiments in a 
		congruent place. </span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-CA" style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;" class="style10"><span class="style6">Through 
		my shamanic journeys at Tie Creek and the teachings from these journeys 
		I was told that this spot and the “extra curricular activity” that took 
		place there was noted by the ancient natives some 8,000 years ago. It 
		was from this time period that the local shamans started their lessons. 
		Through observation and teachings they were shown how to use physical 
		structure (rocks in this case) to align with the nonphysical universal 
		structure to facilitate more efficient connection with other realities.</span><span class="style6" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span class="style4" lang="EN-CA" style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">In the picture series above 
		you can see the entrance angle of the UFO, in relevance to the ancient 
		rock structure. This angle is still marked off by three stones that were 
		placed on the ground many years ago. The ancient ones were very aware of 
		this phenomenon and its entrance porthole into this reality. The whole 
		Tie Creek structure has many different purposes and was constructed over 
		many thousands of years by different subcultures. The shape of the UFO 
		(spherical) is a closer representation of its true shape as the disc 
		shaped UFOs are “perceptional flattened” spheres. This can be 
		demonstrated by UFO observations in historical terms, as seen as sailing 
		ships in the sky and wheels of fire. Each generation will perceive 
		differently, depending on their belief systems and personal experience. 
		Also you can see in the three pictures that this object is entering into 
		a more physical state with the last pictures being a grey colour and the 
		first a more nonphysical energy colour. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		As part of this chamber there is also an ancient first generation of 
		transport device used by the occupants of the UFO. Its operation is 
		similar to the Sonoluminescenc known in science today. This first 
		generation transporter uses harmonics and the quartz crystal matrix of 
		the granite bedrock to create the desired outcome. Apparently they still 
		use the site as a “teaching museum” of sorts to show the evolution of 
		their equipment. I was also shown the second generation and the third,
