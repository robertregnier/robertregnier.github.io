		The sun may be entering a period of reduced activity that could result 
		in lower temperatures on Earth, according to Japanese researchers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">
		Officials of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and the 
		Riken research foundation said on April 19 that the activity of sunspots 
		appeared to resemble a 70-year period in the 17th century in which 
		London’s Thames froze over and cherry blossoms bloomed later than usual 
		in Kyoto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">
		In that era, known as the Maunder Minimum, temperatures are estimated to 
		have been about 2.5 degrees lower than in the second half of the 20th 
		century.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">
		The Japanese study found that the trend of current sunspot activity is 
		similar to records from that period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">
		The researchers also found signs of unusual magnetic changes in the sun. 
		Normally, the sun’s magnetic field flips about once every 11 years. In 
		2001, the sun’s magnetic north pole, which was in the northern 
		hemisphere, flipped to the south.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">
		While scientists had predicted that the next flip would begin from May 
		2013, the solar observation satellite Hinode found that the north pole 
		of the sun had started flipping about a year earlier than expected. 
		There was no noticeable change in the south pole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">
		If that trend continues, the north pole could complete its flip in May 
		2012 but create a four-pole magnetic structure in the sun, with two new 
		poles created in the vicinity of the equator of our closest star.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Archaeologist Francisco 
		Sánchez Nava, of the National Institute of Anthropology and History (<i>INAH</i>), 
		together with archaeoastronomer <span style="color:black">Ivan Sprajc</span>, 
		from the Centre of Scientific Research of the Slovenian Academy of

		Investigating the ancient sites for astronomical alignments<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Through the research, 
		archaeologists are trying to establish archaeo-astronomical patterns to 
		see if these impacted in some way to distribution alignments and 
		placement of pre-Colombian cities and the main structures within 
		Mesoamerica. To date, 150 Maya sites have been investigated in the Gulf 
		of Mexico, the Central Highlands and Oaxaca, with a range of temporal 
		periods from the Formative to the late Postclassic (500 BCE - 1521 CE).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Based on the results so far 
		obtained, Sanchez Nava said that of the buildings that have had 
		alignment measurements taken, more than 70 per cent are solar in nature 
		and their functionality is undoubtedly based on an east-west direction, 
		with Mesoamericans mainly viewing sunrises and sunsets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<h3><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		Equinox did not fit<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
		<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		Although the researchers have no doubt that solstice was important to 
		the people – with alignments found in all the archaeological sites 
		studied so far – the same is not true for equinox.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		Perhaps surprisingly, it seems that <u>equinox alignments are a recent 
		tourist based fashion which have no real basis or hard evidence</u>, 
		with the results of the study reinforcing this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<h3>
		<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		Distinct repeating patterns<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
		<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		Sanchez Nava also explained that they found the patterns of orientation 
		of the buildings built in the majority of archaeological sites of the 
		Highlands are shared with most sites of the Maya Region, in the 
		lowlands, such as Chichén Itzá and Uxmal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		However, at many other Highland sites such as Tonina and Largatero, <u>
		there is a distinct and repeating pattern that still remains a mystery.</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		One hypothesis is the construction and alignment of these Highland Maya 
		sites are related to the cycles of Venus, but the researchers still lack 
		some vital measurements to prove this theory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		Meanwhile, on the north coast of the Yucatan peninsula, on the fringe of 
		Quintana Roo, Sanchez Nava Sprajc found a further alignment pattern 
		different from the previous two: <em>“apparently, architectural 
		alignments of this region are due to the cycles of the moon.”</em> he 
		said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		Sanchez Nava explained <em>“the importance of astronomy in these 
		archaeological sites is beyond doubt, and that for some years it has 
		been accepted that Mesoamerican cities are not distributed randomly, but 
		by strict and defined guidelines, alignments architectural and urban 
		patterns, are all based on a series of observations of the environment 
		as the stars.”</em><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<h3><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		Little hard evidence<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
		<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		However, he said, <em>“the hard evidence was patchy and this is why our 
		project offers a significant sample size of measurements obtained using 
		a standardised methodology, in different cultural regions and different 
		chronologies, so that the results are comparable.”</em><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		They selected the same type of buildings: tall, palace types or temples 
		which had recognisable observational function where the horizons was 
		easily visible. First measurements were taken with a compass, to 
		determine the distribution pattern guidelines, and then with a 
		theodolite for greater accuracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">Ice 
		samples that profile Greenland glaciers have long been used to give 
		climate scientists historical temperature data, but those samples could 
		be misleading, according to a new study published Monday in the 
		Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>A team led by University of 
		Wisconsin-Madison researchers found that the data gathered from the ice 
		cores around Greenland varies greatly from other records of Northern 
		Hemisphere temperatures during the Younger Dryas. Also referred to as 
		the “Big Freeze” — the Younger Dryas was a period of abrupt cooling that 
		began nearly 13,000 years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>“In terms of temperature during 
		the Younger Dryas, the only thing that looks like Greenland ice cores 
		are Greenland ice cores,” said Anders Carlson, a UW-Madison geosciences 
		professor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>“They are supposed to be iconic 
		for the Northern Hemisphere, but we have four other records that do not 
		agree with the Greenland ice cores for that time. That abrupt cooling is 
		there, just not to the same degree.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>While collaborating with 
		UW–Madison climatologist Zhengyu Liu and scientists at the National 
		Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Carlson could reliably recreate 
		temperatures in the Oldest Dryas, a cooling period about 18,000 years 
		ago. But when using the same model to reconstruct Younger Dryas data, 
		the program breaks down around data culled from Greenland ice cores.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In an attempt to understand why 
		the Greenland samples did not match expectations, researchers found that 
		oxygen isotope data did not account for the sort of crash climate change 
		occurring during the Younger Dryas. They also realized their assumption 
		that prevailing winds and jet streams are dumping precipitation from the 
		Atlantic Ocean on Greenland was incorrect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>“The Laurentide ice sheet, which 
		covered much of North America down into the northern United States, is 
		getting smaller as the Younger Dryas approaches,” Carlson said. “That’s 
		like taking out a mountain of ice three kilometers high. As that melts, 
		it allows more Pacific Ocean moisture to cross the continent and hit the 
		Greenland ice sheet.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The two oceans have distinctly 
		different ratios of oxygen isotopes, thus snow that originated from the 
		Pacific will appear much different than Atlantic snow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>“We ran an oxygen isotope-enabled 
		atmosphere model, so we could simulate what these ice cores are actually 
		recording, and it can match the actual oxygen isotopes in the ice core 
		even though the temperature doesn’t cool as much,” Carlson said. “That, 
		to us, means the source of precipitation has changed in Greenland across 
		the last deglatiation. And therefore that the strict interpretation of 
		this iconic record as purely temperature of snowfall above this ice 
		sheet is wrong.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Based on the study’s findings, 
		the researchers said Greenland temperatures may not have cooled as 
		momentously as climate headed into the Younger Dryas relative to the 
		Oldest Dryas, because of the increased levels in atmospheric carbon 
		dioxide that had occurred since the Oldest Dryas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The study also showed that 
		climate change is the result of a confluence of factors and determining 
		historical temperature trends is a highly nuanced science.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>“Abrupt climate changes have 
		happened, but they come with complex shifts in the way climate inputs 
		like moisture moved around,” Carlson said. “You can’t take one 
		difference and interpret it solely as changes in temperature, and that’s 
		what we’re seeing here in the Greenland ice cores.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		New archaeological evidence suggests that America was first discovered

		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		A remarkable series of several dozen European-style stone tools, dating 
		back between 19,000 and 26,000 years, have been discovered at six 
		locations along the US east coast. Three of the sites are on the 
		Delmarva Peninsular in Maryland, discovered by archaeologist Dr Darrin 
		Lowery of the University of Delaware. One is in Pennsylvania and another 
		in Virginia. A sixth was discovered by scallop-dredging fishermen on the 
		seabed 60 miles from the Virginian coast on what, in prehistoric times, 
		would have been dry land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		The similarity between other later east coast US and European Stone Age 
		stone tool technologies has been noted before. But all the US 
		European-style tools, unearthed before the discovery or dating of the 
		recently found or dated US east coast sites, were from around 15,000 
		years ago - long after Stone Age Europeans (the Solutrean cultures of 
		France and Iberia) had ceased making such artifacts. Most archaeologists 
		had therefore rejected any possibility of a connection. But the 
		newly-discovered and recently-dated early Maryland and other US east 
		coast Stone Age tools are from between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago - and 
		are therefore contemporary with the virtually identical western European 
		material.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		What’s more, chemical analysis carried out last year on a European-style

		<p>
		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		Professor Dennis Stanford, of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington 
		DC, and Professor Bruce Bradley of the University of Exeter, the two 
		leading archaeologists who have analysed all the evidence, are proposing 
		that Stone Age people from Western Europe migrated to North America at 
		the height of the Ice Age by travelling (over the ice surface and/or by 
		boat) along the edge of the frozen northern part of the Atlantic. They 
		are presenting their detailed evidence in a new book - Across Atlantic 
		Ice – published this month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		At the peak of the Ice Age, around three million square miles of the 
		North Atlantic was covered in thick ice for all or part of the year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		However, the seasonally shifting zone where the ice ended and the open 
		ocean began would have been extremely rich in food resources – migrating 
		seals, sea birds, fish and the now-extinct northern hemisphere 
		penguin-like species, the great auk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		Stanford and Bradley have long argued that Stone Age humans were quite 
		capable of making the 1500 mile journey across the Atlantic ice - but 
		till now there was comparatively little evidence to support their 
		thinking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		But the new Maryland, Virginia and other US east coast material, and the 
		chemical tests on the Virginian flint knife, have begun to transform the 
		situation. Now archaeologists are starting to investigate half a dozen 
		new sites in Tennessee, Maryland and even Texas – and these locations 
		are expected to produce more evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		Another key argument for Stanford and Bradley’s proposal is the complete 
		absence of any human activity in north-east Siberia and Alaska prior to 
		around 15,500 years ago. If the Maryland and other east coast people of 
		26,000 to 19,000 years ago had come from Asia, not Europe, early 
		material, dating from before 19,000 years ago, should have turned up in 
		those two northern areas, but none have been found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		Although Solutrean Europeans may well have been the first Americans, 
		they had a major disadvantage compared to the Asian-originating Indians 
		who entered the New World via the Bering Straits or along the Aleutian 
		Islands chain after 15,500 years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		Whereas the Solutreans had only had a 4500 year long ‘Ice Age’ window to 
		carry out their migratory activity, the Asian-originating Indians had 
		some 15,000 years to do it. What’s more, the latter two-thirds of that 
		15 millennia long period was climatologically much more favorable and 
		substantially larger numbers of Asians were therefore able to migrate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		As a result of these factors the Solutrean (European originating) Native 
		Americans were either partly absorbed by the newcomers or were 
		substantially obliterated by them either physically or through 
		competition for resources.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		Some genetic markers for Stone Age western Europeans simply don’t exist 
		in north- east Asia – but they do in tiny quantities among some north 
		American Indian groups. Scientific tests on ancient DNA extracted from 
		8000 year old skeletons from Florida have revealed a high level of a key 
		probable European-originating genetic marker. There are also a tiny 
		number of isolated Native American groups whose languages appear not to 
		be related in any way to Asian-originating American Indian peoples.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN">
		But the greatest amount of evidence is likely to come from under the

		off the Ice onto dry land are now up to 100 miles out to sea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
