		Olmec story starts with the collapse of the Shang Dynasty and a group of 
		people that fled from the destruction of that culture. From what I have 
		been told, (from the other side) is that this group did not have much 
		time to prepare and kept their focus on food, water, and basic 
		provisions. During my session I got the impression that the individuals 
		involved in this escape were a group composed mainly of intellectuals, 
		aristocrats and shamans. They had become a liability to the new 
		conquering nation. History does show that there was a focused attempt to 
		eradicate all knowledge of the Shang Dynasty, so it makes sense that the

		no other choice but to get out of Asia and to somewhere far out of 
		reach. From what I was shown, they made their final destination the 
		shores of southern Mexico at the mouth of a river (did not ask what 
		river). Shortly after landing they scuttled the larger boat and 
		continued with smaller ones. They realized that staying close to a river 
		would be their best chance of surviving. Unfortunately their ability to 
		live off the land was not part of their expertise and they soon found 
		themselves in need of food. They traded what they had with small groups 
		of locals and continued to look for a larger urban area were they could 
		exchange their knowledge with others that would recognize their skills. 
		Half starving and on their “last leg” they finally made contact with a 
		larger urban center were they were taken in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		the cultural exchanges started. The legends of this first meeting were 
		immortalized in sculptured stone reliefs, as shown below. Within this

		their cultures. This level can be accessed through angles that are 
		closer associated to the 90 degree direction of the Earth Orb. This is 
		the physical energy flow of all physical realities. Going higher or 
		lower will produce contacts but they are less physically orientated 
		(having less ability to effect in the physical) like angels or animal 
		guides. This connection was the main gift brought over to the Central

		America prior cultures used the Jaguar of the lower world (120 degree 
		connection) as their contact for knowledge. The Dragon connection is 
		closer to the 90 degrees (of the Earth Orb) and is more physically 
		powerful, so the introduction breathed new life into a stagnant culture.

		<p class="Standard" style="text-align: left"><span class="style8" lang="EN-CA">I was told 
		that the scene on the right bottom side of the tree depicts the 
		beginning of a shamanic contact between the Shang Shamans and the 
		Original Mexican shamans. The small figure between them represents a 
		spiritual form of “contactee” or communicator for the two groups. This was 
		prior to any sailing or desperate flight from China and is the reason 
		why it is placed at the bottom right. The stela reads from bottom to top 
		“in time frame” and is divided in to the two stories separated by the 
		tree on top of the land mass of first contact or landing. I was also told 
		because of the ocean origin the dragon became associated with water 
		(Mayan iconolatry) from this ancient legend. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
