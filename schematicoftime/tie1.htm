		source of knowledge the ancients tapped into and it does not come from 
		the intellect. In this reality, life on our planet exists because of its 
		ability to connect to the energy sources that support and allow its 
		creation. With enhanced knowledge the ancients knew how to increase this 
		energy. Their structures were tools that allowed them to become very 
		efficient at creating physical abundance and spiritual awareness. Each

The fragments of this knowledge can be seen in Feng Shui and the East Indian practice of Vastu Vidya, which predates Feng Shui. As I was finishing the first book I came across a book on Vastu Vidya and was delighted to see the basics were there in print. Feng Shui and Vastu Vida are proof that this information was there in the past but through time only small pieces survived. In Vastu Vidya they understand there was a grid, that directions are important, and that different energies associated to different directions and placement in the grid were affecting creation. They also recognize the tilt of the earth as having something to do with it all. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I also recognize their shortcomings in only seeing the singular plane or slice of the total information package. The grid they describe is two-dimensional and is shown as a flat grid when in fact it should be a cube grid or three-dimensional in construct. Feng Shui, like the practitioners of Vastu Vidya, also recognized that building alignment and angle placements were important. This same importance was given to the ancient sites and their alignments. These alignments are in reference to a nonphysical structure that we also share with the sun and stars. However, the sharing is due to our placement in the overall structure itself and its association is more important than visual alignment.</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;

		Having the knowledge to connect to the proper elements was not as 
		easy as we think today. Without compasses and charts the ancients would 
		first have needed to find north, and this would give them all the other 
		angles needed. They did this by first hammering a wooden stake (called a 
		gnomon) into the ground (see above diagram). A circle was then drawn 
		around it, using a piece of string twice the length of the height of the 
		gnomon. Where the shadow of the gnomon touches the circle at sunrise and 
		sunset marked the east and west directions. Two large circles were then 
		drawn using these intersecting points as their centers. These were 
		called the &quot;head and the tail of the fish&quot;, indicating true north and 
		south. The intermediate directions were located by drawing four large 
		circles using primary compass points as their centers and where the 
		circles overlap indicated the exact compass points, as in the above 
		diagram.<br />

The ancient shaman that designed this one was using the prescribed method of finding north and thus his/her desirable 135 degrees. This degree has a very specific use and energy. More will be provided as time goes on, but for now I can say it was to connect to the elemental or slower vibratory levels. The left picture is the actual site element and to the right is a diagram showing the ancient shaman’s method, which is very similar if not exactly as the described methods form the Old-World. <br />

		How the sites work is extremely complicated and it would take the resources of a very knowledgeable shaman/priest. Once the site was built, all could have benefited from its properties. Unfortunately once the original designer was gone, the site could fall victim to others, unfamiliar with designing or misdirected in purposes, or the site was maintained for different needs being synchronized to the cultural needs of the time. The new mystics that came &quot;on line&quot; would obtain and redesign for their own cultural needs. Thus different spiritual or physical needs would be incorporated into the sites and still keep the original site. <br />
		<br />
		People who study the sites have observed that around the world there are common angular positions or directions that the sites would be aligned to. Also noted was that a group of sites on one side of the planet would be aligned in the same angular direction as a completely different site, on the other side of the globe. Both groups of sites could not be visually seeing the same star or planet configuration regardless of the time of day. How then could this be possibly be related to individual constellations or an astronomical point? It can’t but there is another reason for alignments in common directions. Some of the common directions noted around the world are; 12 to19.5 degrees, 52 to 54.5, and 110 to135 degrees. In the Manitoba Whiteshell area, archeologists have for years noticed that the ancient Petroforms (rock mosaics) were aligned at 53.5 degrees. It puzzled them as they scrambled to relate it to something. The sun, moon, and stars had to be the answer, but there was never any valid association found. </span><br />
