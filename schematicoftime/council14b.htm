		consciousness one night while working with the European cave art. During 
		that night I was escorted from the more basic thought patterns of human 
		reality to the most complicated concepts regarding self recognition. The 
		first photo below is of a simple hand from the Chauvet Cave in France. 
		Without judgment or preloaded desire I was introduce to the creation of 
		humanity’s need to experience spiritual connections from the Earth 
		existence. I was not expecting this level of interaction, but I did find 
		it to be one of the most interesting subjects to explore. This is 
		because I realize that all that is created in the physical world comes 
		from a nonphysical template. Understanding different types and levels of 
		consciousness gives one a window into life and our physical reality.

		to stay completely open to other levels of consciousness. Without either

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">The handprint is from an older culture and a different 
		“family” of humans than the Solutreans and Magdalenian that later worked 
		there. Although 2 physical DNA helixes of the 12 can show some

		Gravittian<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">. The image was 
		created as a type of signature, a recognition of self and one’s 
		existence in physical form, or the recognition of being aware and alive 
		in a human body. This might sound very basic but it is a step into 
		higher levels of awareness from the physical animal kingdom (our 
		bodies). This level of awareness is shared by some animal forms but 
		humans have the uniqueness of being able to portray this in an abstract 
		mark of personal recognition. The above picture is a diacritic symbol 
		that speaks of more than just the outline of a human hand. It is a mark 
		that denotes presence. This is similar, but expressed differently, in 
		the animal kingdom. Animals express their presence in life (as a 
		signature) through samples of their biology, called scent. In this 
		method a part of the animal is left to identify personal presences.

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="EN" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
mso-ansi-language:EN;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">You can see the difference here; 
		one is leaving a part of oneself as an identifier, and the other is 
		leaving a thought form as an abstract or abridged identifier. The 
		difference is that consciousness has identified itself outside of the 
		biological apparatus. One sees itself as separate of the physical form. 
		This can only happen if one recognizes that their conscious creative 
		template is from outside of the physical form. This was the breakthrough 
		of spiritual essence in the physical from the animal kingdom! It is the 
		true identifying difference between an ensouled human and an animal. 
		That is not to say animals don’t have souls, for they do. The 
		differences in humans are the composition of their parts. Humans are not 
		animals but are the consciousness of a soul that is co-creating with the 
		soul of their human body. No, we are not invading the human body, we are 
		having a co experience with a life form in the Earth reality. The human 
		consciousness, which resides outside of the body, is in effect 
		co-creating in a symbiotic relationship with its animal physical form.

		forms of consciousness but still a part of one’s reality’s creation.

		from one level of my teachings I am told that they are usually an 
		identity of self or group. This can be seen in the above hand collage 
		from Patagonia, Argentina. I have been told that this mosaic is a Shaman 
		Energy Cache. This cave was used for shamanic practise and teachings 
		with only shamans being allowed to contribute to the mosaic. Each 
		handprint is a signature of personal energy of the shamans that worked 
		there. At this site there were generations of shamanic workers that 
		believed that they were the only ones that could take ownership of this 
		spot and the teachings in the cache. Part of the teaching was the 
		recognition of the masters that came before them. Stories and teaching 
		were downloaded to the student shamans by oral legends and energetic 
		connections associated through the handprints. All teachings were thus 
		iconic to specific signatures of individual prints on the wall. <o:p></o:p>

		energy work they desired. The sacred teachings inspired the followers to 
		contribute their understandings and energy to the wall mosaic. In this 
		type of petroglyph site, identifying to their race and other individuals 
		in their “family” became the focus. It consolidated this part of 
		humanity’s existence into this reality. It is at this point in history 
		that humanity became culture. The definition of culture is the 
		recognition of ones family line and the parts that link physical and 
		spiritual themes into a supported belief system. Expanding and grounding 
		ones consciousness into the physical reality allowed the spiritual 
		connections to be cemented for more efficiency. Soul Groups could then 
		organize into genetic profiles that could work together to establish the 
		exchange of lessons that needed to be experienced, all within the

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">In the Petroglyph mural above (Chauvet Cave) are many 
		layers of teachings that took place, over different periods of time. The 
		mural represents the developmental stages of a new form of corporal 
		search into spirituality. This overall teaching is the third stage of 
		pre religion. In this developmental stage of conscious awareness it is 
		social contribution (ones value in family) that becomes the primary 
		teaching. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">At this developmental time period shamanic teaching 
		needed a new form of communication that others could relate to. The 
		shamans were introducing more abstract concepts of life that we take for 
		granted today. Due to humanity’s emersion out of the natural world of 
		plants and animals, it was understandable that animal’s mobility and 
		their personality traits could be utilized. The known traits of 
		different animal’s behaviour had become an axiom among the hunter 
		gathers of this time. This common knowledge became the bridge for larger 
		community communication. Predictable animal behaviour was easier to 
		describe than the expanse of human personalities. That is without 
		mentioning the fact that shamanic Lower World Power Animals are also 
		selected by their abilities and strengths. It became a dual symbol of 
		choice that all could relate to. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">The caves continued to be centers of teaching for each 
		period and the individual groups working there. In this third level, 
		identifying roles and position in community settings was a new stage of 
		shamanic awareness. This was the beginning of creating a society within 
		the cultural. In this third stage, learning how to co-create or work 
		together for the benefit of all (the families’ strength) was the focus. 
		Observing the animals hunt had shown them the way of strength in 
		numbers. A pride of lions worked together to catch their meals, with the 
		wise and skilled one in the lead as others followed in pursuit. This 
		leader role over the family conformed perfectly within the teaching 
		shaman groups and was a huge step towards creating a culture or 
		civilization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">Division of sexes still maintained natural roles 
		similar to the lion pride with human females hunting along side males if 
		needed. The exception was the same as the lion pride, with the females 
		taking time off from the hunt to raise young. I was told the practise of 
		both sexes hunting was still in use as late as the North American Paleo 
		cultures (Agate Basin and Clovis were specifically mentioned). <o:p></o:p>

		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">On spiritual levels, cultural roles allow different 
		expressions of experience for Soul Groups. The division of the two sex’s 
		ability, times their parental roles, gave more opportunity for a soul’s

		be researched by the incarnating soul. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		aptitude. Many could share the power of the most powerful individual by 
		co-creating in a pack like the lion pride. This also was the beginning 
		of some offshoot ideologies in the shamanic world. There were different 
		interpretations of power and individual needs. Population growth due to 
		climatic restrictions, had forced many different cultural families into 
		smaller areas. This gave rise to more exchange of ideas and the creation 
		of the different shamanic clans. These shamanic clans lasted in North 
		America right up to the nineteen century. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		the murals. In a herd of horses this could be represented by the

		These leaders were always power animals like the bear and rhinoceros. 
		The choice of power animal represented the leader’s abilities and 
		strengths, as recognized by the animals known abilities and habits. 
		Along with the choice of animal was the known connection of the leader 
		shaman’s own Lower World power animal. Each animal also had other human 
		qualities assigned to it. An example of this would be the Rhinoceros as 
		being the protector. The reason to choose a different animal other than 
		the same type of herd animal, was to separate the represented abilities 
		and powers of the shaman leader over the rest of the herd. To show the 
		powerful one amongst the other animals of the herd there had to be an 
		outstanding animal. Staying with the horse symbol in the herd would mean 
		creating a horse that stood out above the others, but creating another 
		horse would lose the different meanings that were also assigned to this 
		leader. The best solution to this was to show a power animal even if it

		characteristics or needs for humanity. All types of cultures or families 
		were using the caves as power centers for their shamans. Each group 
		tolerated the other because there was enough difference of habitat needs 
		in their life styles. Some specialized in hunting specific animals, 
		others focused more on marine life and still others were foragers of

		became the early “spiritual books” of humanity. The master shamans could 
		use the cave as a guide, showing the full spectrum of recorded 
		knowledge, gathered from thousands of years of understandings. These 
		caves became the first depository of spiritual understandings that 
		integrated many different groups into a culture. As the culture’s 
		population grew, the exchange of ideas and skills allowed more freedom 
		for some to hone their own abilities. The first occupational trades were 
		being established in this movement. The shamans typically became 
		artisans while other groups excelled in lithic master pieces and 
		personal adornment. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">This diversifying of people allowed shamanic groups to 
		become more isolated and sophisticated in their teachings and research. 
		Rather than daily needs, they fixated on adventures into the unknown, 
		which led to OBE journeys to different lands. The adventures into 
		different realities can be seen in the so called “geometric cave 
		designs”. These are structural parts of the physical universe and have 
		great accuracy, if you are aware of this structure. <o:p></o:p></span>

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">The prime directive in this new research was the health 
		of the culture itself. It had grown from personal self to “the people”. 
		Seeing the growth in population and the growing scarcity of resources, 
		it made sense to journey (out of body) to search for new lands. It is 
		very easy for a shaman to travel anywhere to witness firsthand what is 
		there. Discovering new land, continents, and islands are all second 
		nature to shamans and their journeys out of body. This new research also 
		created links to the ancestral migration templates. To fulfill this part 
		of their recognition of self, as a culture, it became clear that they 
		needed to retrace their beginnings. The majority decided to return to 
		the legendary ancestral grounds but some shamans from different 
		pre-cultural groups held fast to their own legends, of a different 
		homeland source. These legendary differences led to some groups staying 
		put in their current environment. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">The “homeland” migration came from an established 
		pre-cultural people whose origin was from a prior migration out of the 
		Caucasus area of Eastern Europe. Migrating in two different directional 
		forks these Caucasus people (they called themselves the Douxcan – see 
		statement at bottom of page *) managed to span half of the globe. While 
		one went west, the other left for the east leaving some fragments 
		holding steadfast to the homeland. The group that migrated to the 
		France-Iberia region melded with eleven other groups of people that had 
		also gathered there. The culture that developed during this time period 
		is known today as the Solutreans. Of the two migrating forks of Douxcan 
		people, my teachings call the France-Iberian side group number two. The 
		other fork of this family is called group number 1 as they left slightly 
		before the second migration out of the homeland. Group number one are 
		the ones that ended up in the Americas, to eventually mix in with the 
		Originals that already occupied this land (a huge story that many today 
		have ties to).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p>

		the homeland in the Caucasus area (a shamanic initiated migration) to 
		hear legends of a new land that their ancestors had found (group #1’s 
		Americas). With group number 2’s own pre-research on the subject and now 
		the proof that others had left for a new land, they too followed. This

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">As I was working on this webpage I decided to try some 
		Remote Viewing of the Chauvet Cave. Holding an ancient artifact from 
		France and the time period I managed to get some visions from inside, 
		and at other times, I could not connect at all. On the last attempt I 
		found myself in the cave to the right of this male. The vision was much 
		clearer and in 3D than photo above (Curtis photo of North American 
		native – the closest I could find). All I saw was his shoulders up and 
		some movement in his face. The rest of the cave was black. I watched for 
		at least two minutes before my excitement shifted me from the vision. It 
		took me a few hours to realize that he did not have a beard. Which makes 
		me question why artists always show the “cave men” with burly beards? I 
		have no idea if this was genetics or a custom to shave (which I doubt). 
		The part that excites me the most is that it might show another 
		connection to the Solutreans and some of the North American tribes. The 
		one I was watching was also about ten years younger than this above 
		photo. I had RVed ancient Mayans at Coba, Yucatan before but this was 
		the most ancient vision I have had. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

He explains the difficulty with an analogy: &quot;Imagine you are living in the distant future and only two objects survive from a lost and forgotten past: a painting by Picasso and a painting by Michelangelo. Which is the earlier work and which the later?&quot;</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="style18" style="font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1;">But archaeologists must also be wary of radiocarbon dates, argue Pettitt and Bahn in a paper that appeared in Antiquity last month. Bahn&#39;s suspicions were aroused when he translated the latest coffee-table book on the Chauvet cave into English. Around 30 radiocarbon ages are presented in this book, but the measurements were all made at the same French laboratory. Using results from only one team, however skilled, just is not scientific, says Bahn. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="style18" style="font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1;">Worse, the same laboratory is currently embroiled in an argument over the age of the artwork in another cave, Candamo in Spain. They dated black dots on its walls to 30,000 years ago, but Geochron Laboratories in Cambridge, Massachusetts, estimated the age of a second sample to be just half that.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="style18" style="font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1;">The point is that carbon dating rock art is difficult. Because the samples tend to be incredibly tiny, it is difficult to measure the number of carbon-14 atoms relative to other carbon isotopes - the key ratio for pinning down the age. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Contamination from groundwater or rock scrapings may further confuse the results.&quot; </span></p>
