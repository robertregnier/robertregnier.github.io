		science will never finds out why civilizations end any more than why 
		animal species become extinct. The so called destruction reasons that 
		researchers give, be it famine, war, drought, or anything else are just 
		tools of choice. The combined mass consciousness of those in their specific 
		forms, be it animal or human use these tools to exit from a reality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		group of spirits, the incarnation of certain concentrations of energies 
		and specific elements of a soul group, or the combination of groups. 
		Each epoch brings to the Earth Reality a different group of spirits and 
		a different race. </span>
		<span class="style4" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">When</span><span class="style4" lang="EN-CA"> 
		this race has fulfilled its tasks of carrying out the new ideas and 
		developing their new civilization to its fullest desire it ceases. It 
		functionally has reached its purpose and with this the loss of interest 
		to continue what has been already learnt. The purpose is to evolve and 
		grow as this is the primary driving force behind all spiritual levels. After the 
		accomplishment has been achieved no further incarnations are needed in 
		this level of vibration (civilization in this case). The interest shifts 
		to the next level and in this level a new pre-organized co-creation. These 
		co-creations include new civilizations on Earth or somewhere else and 
		typically in different time frames (for further understandings see “The 
		Schematic of God” book on this site). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<p class="Standard" style="text-align: left"><span class="style4" lang="EN-CA">In every race or 
		culture there are individuals who don’t quite “keep up with the 
		evolutional pace of the majority. So at the end of the civilization’s 
		epoch period these individuals find themselves at lower vibrational 
		states then the majority, and thus need to remain behind. They must 
		continue the reincarnate cycle, as new physical members in an old dying 
		civilization. They are, in a polite way of saying it, prisoners of their 
		own doing, as no one is holding back anyone in this process. They must 
		continue to develop on earth in that level before they can move to the 
		next level of spiritual development. In some civilizations these 
		individuals can recycle for hundreds of years before achieving this. 
		This is not new as it is still going on today with some using their many 
		lifetime experiences to become cultural leaders, this is without 
		achieving higher vibrational states of evolution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<p class="Standard" style="text-align: left"></span><span class="style4" lang="EN-CA">
		<span class="style2">This is the reason why nations experience a sudden 
		decline after achieving a high point in civilization. The highly 
		developed “fathers” (typically the older souls) of the nation are 
		followed by degenerate and weak-willed descendants, and the nation which 
		was once great gradually falls into debility and disrepute. This is very 
		noticeable in all civilizations and can be easily potted out in the 
		Mayan history as an example. The last true “fathers” or builders of the 
		Mayan civilization started to leave around 350AD but it took another 500 
		years after that to dissemble it for good. This epic transformational 
		time period was not just isolated to the Maya as many other cultures 
		responded to the cycles’ end with disassembling of their civilization. 
		As this period of time (around 400 AD) took place the ones leftover 
		(lower vibrational ones) were in higher concentrations and a new stage 
		of dismantling took place. During the Mayan dissembling others from 
		adjacent cultures moved in with their agendas and political abilities. 
		These lower vibrational ones easily meshed in with the ones left behind 
		of equal value. This can be seen in the newer structures and reliefs at 
		Chichen Itza with skulls and sacrifice imagery being added to the older 
		Mayan benign structures. Unfortunately some modern researchers have a 
		tendency to paint the entire history of a civilization with the same 
		brush. They typically find more artifacts from the newest levels and 
		thus use these dismantling times to form a template for the entire 
		history of the culture. This would be similar to a future archaeological 
		study on a World War 2 Nazi mass grave site as evidence that our twenty 
		first century culture practised mass sacrifices.&nbsp; </span> <o:p></o:p>

		<span class="style2">I was shown that over a few generations the “Shang 
		Shamans” (my way of separating the two groups) became more powerful and 
		secretive with their power. This was not met with acceptance by the 
		bulk of the population and especially the shamans belonging to some of 
		the “Original clans”. The cultures that united in the past now started 
		to separate, through segregated shamanic clans. As the elite “Shang 
		type” of shamans became more powerful they also became aware of their 
		fragile security, as they were outnumbered. Their shrines (the power 
		source) were now being created in secrecy to protect them. This 
		usually meant burying them under the floors of their compounds. In the 
		La Venta pyramid Complex “A” there are more than 50 separate caches and 
		shrines by one count, including buried Jade celts, polished mirrors made 
		of iron-ores, and five large shrines composed of Serpentine blocks. One 
		of the Serpentine caches is estimated to contain 50 tons of carefully 
		finished serpentine blocks, covered by 4,000 tons of clay fill. (<a href="council17.html">For 
		more understanding of Shrines</a>). </span>
		<span class="style2" style="mso-themecolor: text1">Among the unearthed 
		shrines in Complex A were 3 rectangular mosaics each roughly 15 ft. × 20 
		ft. with each consisting of up to 485 blocks of serpentine. These blocks 
		were arranged horizontally to form what has been variously interpreted 
		as an ornate Olmec bar-and-four-dots motif of the Olmec Dragon. The 
		photo shown below of the mask is the proper orientation of this dragon&#39;s 
		face and is an icon of the Shang dragon </span>

		council. Together they create a cache that is no different than the 
		caches mentioned from North America (<a href="council6.html">see Cache Page</a>). Each shaman gave 
		an extremely valuable part of themselves to this shrine. Each position 
		and angle is connected to many of the 360 degrees of the Universal Orb, and 
		through a

		The original intent of the shrine was to “ground” the dying culture into 
		the physical, to give them a longer lasting time period. They had seen 
		the end of their way of life and were trying to stop this end from 
		reaching their level of reality. The seventeen figurines and seven celts 
		were buried to ground the specific individual energies of these powerful 
		members and their consenting laws. Unfortunately the seventeen and the elder died 
		shortly after this shrine’s creation. This meant that he was more 
		connected to nonphysical realities and not as powerful now in the 
		physical. He had transcended into the next level of their evolution, but 
		his essence and membership was still part of the shrine. This was 
		interpreted by one of the members as a leakage of energy and 
		justification to have this part removed from the shrine. Anyone working 
		with shrines will understand this position of choice. The concerned 
		shrine member decided to reopen the shrine to a level where they 
		could see the elder’s statue and remove it along with one celt. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		non-interference law had to be removed. Unfortunately the shrine and the 
		re arrangement did not work. The reason is that the attempt was not in 
		line with their evolution. The evolution and the dismantling of the 
		culture was next in line for all of them,
