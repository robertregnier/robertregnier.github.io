		<p class="style20" style="mso-themecolor: text1">This is an impressive circle even though it is not large in diameter, nor the stones of any great size. As a structure it seems to create an aura of mystery and even power. It is indeed unfortunate that some individuals have deemed it OK to leave bunches of rotting <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>flowers intertwined with tatty, non-degradable plastic ribbon around the centre stone and have burned designs into the grass just inside the circle. Our ancestors built these structures for purposes known only to them and so should remain exactly as they left them. If some believe there are &quot;spirits&quot; at the site then an appropriate offering would <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>be to keep the site clear of brush and clean. If all visitors behaved as these few, the site <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>would be surrounded by burned and blackened grass and knee deep in tatty bits of plastic.<o:p></o:p></p>

		<span class="style4">Below Leskernick</span><p class="style3"><span class="style4" style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Since the circle here was not named on the O.S. map, we temporarily termed it the unknown circle. We found it just by following the map and at first sight we could see that it was indeed a circle. The stones which form it are all &quot;recumbent&quot; and may have always been that way. I could see no well defined socket holes as is often the case with fallen stones. All of them fell on a dowsed circle and if I judge by the dowsed cross-alignments I found there may have been two stones missing from <span style="color:fuchsia">D</span> &amp; <span style="color:fuchsia">E</span>. Several stones, those at <span style="color:fuchsia">F</span>, <span style="color:fuchsia">G</span> &amp; <span style="color:fuchsia">H</span> were cross aligned with two &quot;opposite numbers&quot;. From <span style="color:fuchsia">G1</span> &amp; <span style="color:fuchsia">E1</span>, there were alignments to a large stone at <span style="color:fuchsia">K</span> and one from <span style="color:fuchsia">K</span> to a stub in the turf at <span style="color:fuchsia">B</span>. There the line ended. Within the circle, after a bit of slow meandering, a slow spiral was revealed which I first followed to an approximate centre where the rods rotated slowly. Following it in the opposite direction I found it exiting the circle at stone <span style="color:fuchsia">A</span>. The spiral then took a loop around the circle, intersected the <span style="color:fuchsia">K/B</span> line, crossed a small stone at <span style="color:fuchsia">C</span> and finally appeared to straighten out and head off on an approximate<span style="color:fuchsia"> 260</span> degree heading which would be toward the hut circles on Codda Down. I was getting anxious to head for Altarnun and so did no more except to locate the remains of another circle of about 3 stones. Continue below the diagram.</span><span class="style4"> </span></p>
		<p class="style12" style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">I have to admit that we did not plan to visit this circle at all. In fact, we only came upon it by accident brought about by an error in map reading by a certain lady whom I won&#39;t mention by name. The plan had been to re-visit Altarnun and the unmentionable lady had found &quot;an easier way in&quot;. There was certainly a circle in the area, actually two, but neither as it turned out was Nine Stones, Alt. I had the map, appropriately folded in its holder and found, (en route to Altarnun, I thought), a circle in which all the stones were lying flat. We spent quite a bit of time on it and diagrammed it as shown above, found a second one which was only three flat stones, then went on looking for Nine Stones. After a short while I realized that the terrain didn&#39;t look right at all and after much stomping around and a frustrating study of the map, discovered our error. We were quite a way from Altarnun, in fact on wrong side of the A30. Only on looking at the map later and reading a report from a friend did I realize, we&#39;d been to Leskernick!</p>

We did get a bit of help in the lane about half a mile away, this little sign was wedged into the hedgerow close to where we parked the car.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="style12" style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Dowsing the circle provided some interesting results which are shown on the diagram above. This was a bit difficult to do in many spots due to the hostile brush which left a goodly number of abrasions on my hide. All the stones of the circle fell on the dowsed outline which delineated the boundary of the structure. The pair of recumbent stones between numbers <span style="color:
fuchsia">1</span> &amp; <span style="color:fuchsia">19</span> dowsed as a separate structure, but I forgot to see if the dowsed line joining them was also ritual in nature. There was rotation of the rods over the outer of the two, which indicates an interment. This stone is not found on other diagrams of this site. I wonder if the inner of the pair originally stood at the point where the dowsed path from stone <span style="color:fuchsia">8 </span>ends at the circle boundary. The dowsed path from stone <span style="color:fuchsia">9</span> also ends at the boundary between <span style="color:fuchsia">18 </span>&amp; <span style="color:fuchsia">19</span> and not at a stone as do the dowsed paths connecting all the others. </p>
		<p class="style3"><span class="style4" style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The stones at <span style="color:fuchsia">6, 7</span> and <span style="color:fuchsia">13</span> all connect with two opposite stones</span><span class="style4">. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Stone <span style="color:fuchsia">6</span> connects across the circle with <span style="color:fuchsia">14</span> and <span style="color:fuchsia">15</span>, between which is a recumbent stone, (shown in <span class="style13">pink</span>), not found on the diagrams I have seen</span>. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">From this stone a dowsed ritual path extends on a heading of approx. 105 degrees. Another ritual path beginning at stone <span style="color:fuchsia">19</span> passes through stone <span style="color:fuchsia">10</span>, then onward on a heading of approx 30 degrees perhaps toward a group of hut circles and an enclosure about half a mile away in that direction. Stone <span style="color:fuchsia">7</span> is connected by paths to stones <span style="color:fuchsia">17</span> and <span style="color:fuchsia">18</span>, the latter again shown in green is not found on other diagrams of the site. The dowsed paths from stone <span style="color:fuchsia">13</span> connect to stones <span style="color:fuchsia">3</span> and <span style="color:fuchsia">4</span>. The small recumbent stone behind <span style="color:fuchsia">10</span> apparently has no significance to the structure or paths, it was recorded at the time because it was there.</span></span></p>
		<p class="style3"><span class="style4" style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">At the approximate centre of the circle, <span style="color:fuchsia">R</span>, the rods rotated indicating an interment of some kind. From this point a spiral was found to wind out in a clockwise manner exiting the circle just before the eastern corner of stone <span style="color:fuchsia">15</span>. Here, the single path split into four but following them became impeded by thick and thorny brush so I could not really resolve even approximate headings or see any likely termination point</span><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">s.</span></p>

As the top picture shows, the ancient stone row and the wall or fence, are in close proximity and in some places they become one and the same. This whole area is full of rows, cairns and cists, a few of which a few are barely discernible now. The Sharpitor West and Hart Tor sites have fared a little better than most, but all are a bit too close to the Princetown/Plymouth road.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:

I had seen it through binoculars while doing Hart Tor last year. Anyway, I backtracked the line to a single stone <span style="color:fuchsia">A</span>, where it terminated, then in the other direction, <span style="color:fuchsia">140</span>, to another stone, <span style="color:fuchsia">B</span>, where it again appeared to terminate. There were however, lines propagating away at right angles to the original which looped around to pass through several more stones to form a circle. Further investigation resulted in the two configurations shown below. The stone at <span style="color:fuchsia">A</span> was about 80 paces from <span style="color:fuchsia">B</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;

As though a continuance of the incoming alignment, albeit with a kick to a<span style="color:fuchsia"> 160</span> heading, a line continued through a stone in the boundary wall, between two row stones, and passing through a small group on to where I know not. While identifying the row alignment, I noticed two areas <span style="color:fuchsia">M</span> and <span style="color:fuchsia">N, </span>of disturbed soil and stone debris. Near the centre of each, the rods were found to rotate and from both these points, clockwise spirals looped out to link with circles near the edge of each area. Again, in both cases an outer circle encompassed each of the two. I believe These were disturbed, (ruined), cairns. All of this we observed before beginning on the row, which turned out to be one of the least complex I

The hut circles proved to be most interesting as many of them had storage or pen areas attached to them. The hut, or living areas invariably had a ritual path beginning at the entrance and running straight down the centre to the opposite wall. I have shown these paths in green on the diagram. In hut <span style="color:fuchsia">5</span>, there were four flat stones close to the eastern side wall which fell on a dowsed line and I assumed them to have been a bed or shelf. This same hut also had it&#39;s entrance protected by a &quot;hallway&quot;, the entrance to which was some five or six feet to the left of the hut entry. The ritual path however, still began at the hut entry and was not present in the &quot;hallway&quot;. This layout was unique to hut <span style="color:fuchsia">5</span>. Hut <span style="color:fuchsia">4</span> also had it&#39;s own unique layout in that both parts of the structure dowsed as living quarters and had ritual paths which were not on the same alignment. Were these close neighbours? or was it a two room house? Perhaps they had noisy children or a live- in mother-in-law. A couple of the huts also had what appeared to have been a hearth stone or quern close to one wall of the structure. The walls of all hut circles and storage areas dowsed as structures and are shown with a red line. The compounds just inside the modern entrance had no dowsed entrances but I assume they would have contained livestock or perhaps have been larger storage buildings. The limits of these structures are also outlined with red.</span><span class="style4" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">.

By it&#39;s presence I can determine that the structure was for human habitation, rather than storage or animal shelter or confinement, in which case there is no path. This really needs to be verified at all sites containing these structures, but I&#39;ll bet on it&#39;s validity.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:

It takes about 2-21/2 hours of rough walking to get to the beginning so the prospect of another 6640m while taking the time to dowse it bears some thinking about at the age of 63. We&#39;ll see, I&#39;d dearly love to do it but maybe forget the dowsing!</span><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="style3"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">This is not the best of diagrams, the blue circles are supposed to be concentric and roughly equidistant but this is the best I could manage with &quot;Paint&quot;. There was an alignment which began at a small stone to the SW of the circle, passed through another stone and made a tangential contact with the circle as shown. It continued on at a bearing of approx. 70W but was not pursued more than about 100 yards. There were 6 dowsable circles within the stone circle and one more about 6 paces outside it&#39;s diameter. The one around the diameter tended to join the stones of the circle although some were not quite &quot;in line&quot;. I only followed the row for a little way, too. Just to see it disappear over yon far hill was enough to discourage me, besides the fact that we had a pretty rough 2 hours walk out still to go. This is one of the most emotion producing sites for me, don&#39;t know why.</span></p>
