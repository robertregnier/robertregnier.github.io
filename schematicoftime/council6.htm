		to connect all the member shamans, including the generations prior to 
		them, which were obviously separated by many miles and years. Each 
		generation’s participating shamans created their own blades and added it 
		to the Cache. Over time this added up to many blades and many individual 
		energy signatures. Some Cache blade collections were typically complete 
		family energetic “collages or melanges” of individual shaman initiates 
		as well as masters. Sometimes these Cache Blade collections grew very 
		large as they accumulated over the generations turning into an energy 
		entity within itself. This “entity signature” of a group has the power 
		to act as a connecting reference point or beacon for all aspects 
		involved. These collections were placed in selected spots (sacred sites 
		at the Earth’s vortex points) to act as a transformer (similar to the 
		larger sacred sites) broadcasting this combined energy into areas where

		As can be expected, other members of the cultures would not be aware of

		You cannot enter without invitation, for one has to be eligible and 
		capable of entering. This eligibility is governed by ones own desires

		These gatherings have been going on for thousands of years at many of 
		the sacred sites. The sacred sites became and are the medium, the

		One last thing, all cache blade collections were not for shamanic 
		purposes. The more recent vintage ones also served as methods of storing 
		rather than carrying the weight of many prefaces for the future 
		manufacturing of projectile points (especially within trade routes).

		My advice is to spend as much time as possible at a sacred site. If you 
		are trying the artifact method, you do not need complete intact 
		artifacts nor is there a need to spend a lot of money on them. In fact I 
		have been told that if they are broken they are even more efficient to 
		work with. There are a few reasons for this, but the main one is the 
		emotional impetus that was sent into the artifact upon its destruction. 
		A re-sharpened and re-broken (in the past) artifact can also increase 
		this ability to connect. One thing is important if a targeted time 
		period is being researched, it is nice to have enough of the artifact to 
		identify its approximate cultural chronology. Even if the scientific 
		chronology is not very accurate, it is helpful in the bigger picture of 
		understandings as to who is who. Recently, I have been informed that 
		even a flake off the original tool is as good to work with. The creation 
		of the tool or projectile point has a specific energy/creation that 
		comes from the creator’s consciousness. The tool maker applies force to 
		create it and this force is imprinted into the flake as well as the 
		tool. <o:p></o:p>

		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		By force I don’t mean the physical sticking of the knapper’s hammer, as 
		it is actually the force of conscious desire that becomes imprinted. The 
		tool might have many such strikes in its creation but apparently this 
		doesn’t increase its power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		A note here: the flake will be on a different level of information and 
		energy or purpose than the finished product.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		</span>The finished artifact will be linked more to the physical 
		emotional imprinting of desire – the desire to create in the physical. 
		This gives the tool or finished artifact the ability to become an icon 
		for the conscious plan of the moment of its creation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		The variables for this process are endless, but this information does 
		give some direction in what is needed. One last thing to mention here; 
		the more individuals from the past we have connections to, the stronger 
		the position will be. The ancient shamans in North America understood 
		how collecting individual energies was a powerful tool. The first 
		shamans to understand this would have started a collection of their 
		different source energies and helpers (Communicators and Translators). 
		As time went on this collection was passed onto the next generation of 
		shamans (an inheritance). More was added by the new generation and some 
		objects rejected because those aspects were dealt with. In time it was 
		recognized that capturing or imprinting of the shaman themselves was all 
		that was needed to access his or her “energy files”. From here it was 
		just a matter of identifying that rocks (quartz based material) had a 
		great ability for storage of energy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		The most precious tools or lithics were the projectile points or the 
		early tooling stages of them called performs. These blade collections 
		became the connectors and icons of past shamans. With each new 
		generation of initiated shamans, another piece was added to the cache. 
		Some cultures I have been told only added to the Cache after the 
		initiate passed the tests. One of these styles of tests can be seen in 
		the Nazca Lines. These lines were the proof that the initiate had the 
		ability to go Out Of Body (OBE) by describing what form they saw on the 
		ground. (No, there were no UFO landing pads involved! – This idea came 
		from a non-shaman.) <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
