		truth is they will never be able to produce the complete picture. Along 
		with the scientific information you have other varied interest groups, 
		all their own agendas that range from pseudoscientific, native legends, 
		and New Age fields. I will not entertain any of these fields simply 
		because I need to remain pure to what I have been taught. I found out 
		many years ago that if you try to correlate your research with others it 
		ends up being a watered down version of what the true teachings could 
		have been. Bottom line is; I just want to know what and how it all 
		happened and there are no solutions on the horizon so I had to develop 
		my own method of exploring the past. The only way that this can be 
		accomplished is to go back or to make contact with the past. Everything 
		I have been shown and taught is from the “horse’s mouth” and has not 
		been embellished in anyway or for anyone’s sake. The information on this 
		website has no political, religious, scientific, or self-serving 
		intents; it is as I have been shown. I also don’t care or have any 
		interest in the argument of what color skin these people of the past 
		had. This topic is for the simple minded ones that cannot see past their 
		present fragile existence. If these people and science in general only 
		knew, the topic would cease to exist. To give you an idea of what I’m 
		talking about we only have to look at ancestral worship. It is an enigma 
		for modern science to full grasp why someone put so much importance in 
		honouring their ancestors. Well frankly it is because these ancestors 
		are us. Every past life you lives on Earth plane is in you DNA and will 
		always be there even into your next lifetime. Ancient people are far 
		more connected to this understanding and honouring these past ancestors 
		is honouring yourself. All the lesions learnt in a lifetime are still in 
		you and can be accessed. We are a compilations of our lesions. Asking

		these lesions and the past knowledge.</span><span class="style2" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

		From the completion of an expression (in this case human) we are drawn

		<span class="style2">When talking about a thousand years we have a 
		tendency to skip through it in conversation as if it was yesterday and 
		completely understood. The truth is, it is hard for anyone to imagine a 
		few hundred years ago, so when given a sum of ten thousand years or 
		more, it is not consciously possible to fathom this on any level other 
		than the comment itself. Interestingly there are legends in <u>some</u> 
		native cultures that refer to their past origins in North America as 
		being the original race. This could be more truth than is presently 
		accepted as we have not yet defined “original”. </span>

		<span class="style2">My teachings agree with archaeology when it 
		mentions there were coastal people (boat people) and land people (foot 
		migrations). Of the four big migrating groups there were two “land 
		people”, groups that came overland into the new world but later than the 
		boat people. The boat people came in two big waves separated by a couple 
		thousand years. These two distinct groups were from a single family that 
		originated in the Caucasus Mountain and Caspian Sea area. They were 
		originally from a family known today as the Solutreans, but what is not 
		known is that they existed long before the recognized Solutrean culture.</span><span class="style2" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		</span><span class="style2">They broke up from a single family thousands 
		of years prior with a group migrating to the land known today as France 
		and Spain (our recognized Solutrean group). The main or original home 
		group stayed behind only to migrate separately on its own a few thousand 
		years later. This original Solutrean group ended up on the west coast of 
		North America. The separation of the two groups led to differences and 
		animosity between them as they both eventually ended up in North 
		America. In other words, they were ancient enemies, a state that still 
		has an unrecognized hold on some of the native people of today. There is 
		much more to this story but for now it is enough to show how far back 
		issues can go and why connecting to the past must be done. This enemy 
		base was created in Eastern Europe and in very distant past, 19,000 
		years ago and more. This emotion still lingers in time (locked in 
		emotional DNA code levels) and there are even those in the past that I 
		have connected to that will not help for these reasons. The Kennewick 
		Man was from the second Solutrean group and many thousands years later.
		</span><span class="style2" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="style2">One 
		can almost liken it to a family fight of sorts, for these fights seem to 
		hold more emotionally charged energy than any other! </span> <o:p></o:p>

		<span class="style2">Including the Originals, five main families 
		eventually settled in North America with a few short lived outside 
		groups intermixed with them. There were two groups that came out of 
		Siberia as well as two along the coast. Below are maps and a chart that 
		show the basics. In the chart you will see arrows pointing up, down, or 
		sideways. These are indications of cross breeding between groups. The 
		groups or families are from actual Soul Groups that have agreed to 
		incarnate in the physical. As time progresses and Earth vibration shifts 
		take place, many different Soul Groups become involved in the families. 
		That is until the family finds itself in a balanced state of completion 
		with the original design or desire. It is at this point of balance that 
		the family is complete, with their purpose being fulfilled, the family 
		“dies” off. In other words the family doesn’t make the next vibrational 
		shift and the members (on soul levels) have moved on to other forms or 
		families in the next shift. This is all very complicated and would take 
		many pages to explain, so it is better left for a book.</span><span class="style2" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

		I have looked into the different families from the first modern humans 
		and have found that it is easier to identify the differences between 
		them as compared to say just the last 5000 years. As the families mixed 
		creating larger populations they also become very mixed and diversified 
		in spiritual origins and levels. This diversity becomes so complex that 
		I have been told it is of no value in recording the movement of it. <o:p></o:p>
