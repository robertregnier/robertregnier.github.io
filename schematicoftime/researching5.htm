		As seen above in the Jenny harmonic photo (a basic view) the sphere’s 
		boundaries lay outside the cube boundaries and thus the spheres come in 
		contact with each other. With two spheres crossing over each other’s 
		boundaries an interference boundary is created (at the grid lines). This 
		interference zone will become its own structure and will have its own 
		inherent flow pattern. This zone will also have properties or energies 
		common to the two host spheres. The zone is commonly known as the Vesica 
		Piscis but I have been instructed to call it the “Patch”. As said above 
		all structures have banded layers or shells. This is due to harmonic 
		shifts or “notes” in the octave of every structure. <o:p></o:p></span>

		As two adjacent spheres overlap their shells they become immersed into 
		each other’s different vibratory flavours (see diagram below). In the 
		universal structure all forms regardless of their commonality will have 
		their own individual signature energy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		Therefore, adjacent spheres become co-partners to another structure call 
		a Patch. This patch can be seen below as one sphere rotates its shells 
		into the other rotating sphere. There is a mixing of two different 
		levels of vibration. One sphere’s lower outer vibrational shells mix 
		with the inner higher shells of the second sphere. This means the outer 
		lower shells are now co creating with higher shells of creation. This 
		creates an incredible amount of energetic exchange as the vibrational 
		states seek to find resonate balance between them. This is also the 
		start of the duality of a reality. The union of two orbs is the “Patch”, 
		an area of combined energies and a zone of independent creation that 
		shares vibration from its “parents”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

		The intermixing of different shells create their own dynamic realities,

		below (a two dimensional “slice”) you can see the many combinations with 
		just in a few shells from two spheres. The zone in the middle (between 1 
		and 2) is called the “90 Degrees”. In this area there is little movement 
		in structural creation for it is too active and is called a neutral 
		energy zone, even with this activity. (In a consciousness level two

		The shells are the edges of spheres and are not recognizable as you go 
		inward to the center of the orb or outward to the cube. This is due to 
		the higher or lower vibrations and the lack of any physical form. The 
		shells are a banding of concentric layers due to “harmonic octaves”. 
		Each octave and its “composite of notes” will have its own specific 
		flavor or vibration. These octave differences will define the boundaries 
		between each shell or band. The outer shells are a composition of many 
		layers of energetic density. There are also many sphere structures that

		Shells are very important to understand for they explain how an 
		observable effect is only a small aspect of the complete system. 
		Examples of our detectable energies are light, radiation, magnetism, 
		electricity, and gravity but they are but small aspect of the same 
		larger energy source. The source energies are unlimited in power and 
		unique but filtered into their respective dimensional shells and our 
		interpretations. <o:p></o:p>

		So in truth, physical realities are graduations of vibrational 
		intensities that group through common resonance (octaves). Starting from 
		the original harmonic structure of this universe there are ever 
		increasing and decreasing layers of energy. All these layers are 
		separated by structural harmonic differences as discussed prior. These 
		are the shell boundary areas and they are separated by vibrational 
		scales. Within the shells are decreasing levels of vibration and 
		individual flavors of this original energy. Each shell is composed of 
		the source energy but each shell will have its “interpretation” of this 
		energy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		To be in observance of any shell you must be part of it. This is only 
		possible if you are of that or a similar vibrational signature. Each 
		shell will have its “octave” of energy and in this octave will be the 
		individual “notes” of the octave. So each shell could be called an 
		octave scale of the other. Inside each note layer (within the parent 
		octave) would be another mini octave that breaks down into its 
		individual “notes”. (There are ten octaves in our physical system with 
		5.5 of them being perceivable by us. In the last four octaves are many 
		mid tones, each registering its own state of motion.) <o:p></o:p>
