		of 12 different groups of people. It was through the exchange of ideas 
		and technologies of these 12 amalgamated peoples that a new alliance was 
		created. They had varying abilities in human evolution and spiritual 
		awareness but together they created the most important and culturally 
		innovative movements in history. I’m told that the Solutreans were a 
		confederation more than a true culture and were the creation of shamanic 
		councils that were working and sharing the same sacred caves shown in 
		the last page (pg.14b). The Solutreans were so historically important 
		that in my first inquires about them I had trouble accessing any 
		information at all. I was told this was due to the fact that it had to 
		be accurate and historically all encompassing, otherwise nothing would 
		be divulged. This is the reason why so many varied subjects are 
		addressed in this brief story of the Solutreans. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">After a three year period of shamanic work, I now have 
		a good chronology of the events that led up to the peopling of the 
		Americas and a migration that seeded future cultures on both sides of 
		the globe. It must be understood that the Solutreans were not the first 
		people to the Americas. <u>The Americas were populated by two different 
		surviving groups prior to the Solutrean migrations; these people are 
		referred to (by my sources) as the “Originals” (in this case, of the 
		Americas).</u> Originally there were three families in the Americas but 
		the northern family did not survive. A group from the middle original 
		family lived in the Valsequillo Reservoir area of Mexico and a southern 
		family can be found in South America (as demonstrated in the Sumidouro 
		and Lagoa Santa Sites of Brazil). To put this in a historical context 
		these people can be equated to the European Acheulean level, and of the 
		same time period! </span>

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">Very briefly; all animals are created in three versions 
		of their species, humans are no exception. Two variants will be 
		energetically opposite of each other, to create a genetic and energetic 
		balance in a reality. The third variant acts as a catalyst to create 
		movement within this balanced duet. By creating imbalance within the 
		other two variants it allows evolution or growth can take place. This is 
		the only way to maintain existence in the physical reality, for any 
		length of time (no growth – no purpose – no longevity). These third 
		variants are always from a higher or lower vibrational level than the 
		other two physical “seed variants”. In fact, the third variant injection 
		into the reality may or may not be a physical form. To understand human 
		evolution you must see the three variants or “families” in any given 
		time period or region. That also includes today’s people. This 
		understanding is not withholding that one or two variant parts can 
		become extinct leaving the lasts variant in the physical for a 
		predetermined period of time. This determined time period is dependent 
		on many things including soul level requirements and the environment’s 
		vibrational level that can support these requirements.

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">Briefly again, my teachings started with what is 
		referred to as the “European Originals”. Historically we call them the 
		Acheuleans, although academics only see one or possible two types, there 
		were in fact many. Around 100,000 years ago the first true humans were 
		created. Academics also want to see older versions of bipeds as humans 
		too, but they were not. As addressed in the last page, humans are an 
		ensoulment of two different soul aspects. A true human conscious form is 
		more than the physical biological apparatus, which consists of its own 
		consciousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">As with humans, all animals are created in threes, with 
		the third variant influencing the other more physical reality forms. The 
		rate of injection of this third sphere dictates the species speed of 
		evolution. In modern humans this speed is thousands of times quicker due 
		to higher vibrational injection. In the beginning of true humanity, 
		regional bipeds (human body forms) were used as seedlings for this third 
		spiritual injection (our consciousness). This could be a lower or higher 
		vibration depending on the region’s environmental vibration. The Earths 
		vibration is always cyclically shifting, so some species will not fit 
		into the new vibrations. Yes, evolution of species and the extinction of 
		some are not a negative thing for life forms, as their individual 
		vibrational rates must comply with their environment’s vibration. Human 
		DNA shows itself in the physical, with two helixes matching the 
		environment’s vibration and a third as an injected nonphysical 
		influence. These nonphysical helixes continue up in 12 levels and are 
		always nonphysical, in this present Earth reality. <o:p></o:p></span>

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">Encompassing most of the planet, the Acheulean 
		proto-cultures of 100,000 years ago consisted of 18 different types of 
		true humans. The pattern of three variants were created in 6 different 
		regions or land masses (no, Africa is not the birth place of humanity, as 
		there were several places). Not all of these Acheulean types survived 
		due to regional vibrational and climatic variants, but the initial 
		creation of three had to be there to kick start the physical survivors, 
		be it one, two, or all three types. They created localized 
		proto-cultures that survived for thousands of years. These 
		proto-cultures eventually met their neighbours and mixing occurred. The 
		blending of different human species created the groups of the Upper 
		Palaeolithic (Gravittian and others like the Douxcan – Pre Solutreans). 
		Parts of Darwin’s theory are correct just like parts of the 
		creationist’s understandings are correct, but there is much more 
		involved. Basically, species can “ignite” into existence, and yes they 
		do evolve from there. I understand that this statement might appear to 
		be illogical to many but if your only focus on life is the physical; 
		then 90% of the information is missing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">The bottom line is that all specie’s templates can be 
		found in our DNA, which gives an insight into what purpose “junk DNA” 
		has. It is consciousness (an aspect not found in the physical mind) that 
		dials in the desired form through all the possible DNA blueprints. This 
		will always be an ongoing issue for mapping genealogy or race, as you 
		cannot back track consciousness through a chemical analysis. The diagram 
		I was shown consisted of thousands of parallel strands of physical 
		reality possibilities (coordinated with DNA variety), and through these 
		strands was a weaving consciousness. So following a DNA strand back in 
		time can show a probable past time form, but not necessarily in the 
		family line you are interested in or following. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">To make things even more complicated, time frames are 
		not consistent. They vary throughout the universe, and the Earth’s own 
		past. Every Earth Shell Level had a different time frame, in comparison 
		to today perception (our Reality Shell). After all, what separates 
		events is not time but the perception of time. We perceive events in a 
		lineal fashion, or “one event at a time”. Lifetimes, even within 
		reincarnation profiles, are not in a lineal time frame. (For the alien 
		buffs out there, this is the reason why Zeta Reticuli need to tag 
		individuals when following the family line.)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

		They see humans coming from a long line of biological evolutionary links 
		going back into the range of a million years. These individuals were not 
		true humans as they were not of human consciousness. Bones and tools 
		will never show the levels that make up the conscious composite we call 
		human. The others were life expressions of biological form without human 
		ensoulment. Species wise, there is no difference between fifty types of 
		apes in the Miocene any more than many prototypes of humans, after all 
		nature tries on many garments before selecting survivors. Also, the

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">During the upper Palaeolithic period different groups 
		of people populated the French-Iberian Peninsula. Their style of life 
		had been untouched for thousands of years, that is until the environment 
		changed in other areas. It was this change that led to the migration of 
		an eastern group of people that changed everything for them. These 
		eastern people were of a different creed and vibration. Their awareness 
		level showed in their creativity, this is a powerful aptitude that 
		allows one to accept change. As their environment changed and resources 
		pushed them into wider fields of travel they soon realized that it was 
		time to search for a new land of plenty. Because they had spread so wide 
		in their original domain it was natural that some would migrate east and 
		others would go west. These people of the Caucasus where hemmed in 
		between two seas and a mountain range. Although some did travel south 
		the largest movement became a migration over the top of the seas in 
		opposite directions. Their path into Western Europe crossed local 
		sedimentary peoples allowing for an exchange of ideas and technologies. 
		This was also repeated in the eastern migration through Asia and 
		Siberia. The evidence of this will not be found, as it is subtle, 
		showing only as enhanced technologies that they already had. For the 
		eastern migration, this unique journey allowed for an exchange of some 
		ideas but it was not until they settled down in the Iberian Peninsula

		(Douxcan) people are the “third group injection” for this region of 
		human development. Being of a higher vibration made them a catalyst for 
		creating the Solutrean Confederation. I was told that this eastern group 
		of people called themselves the Douxcan. The name is a base name as 
		prefixes were added to signify areas or abilities of different parts of 
		this family group. Their origin was the Caucuses and they entered the 
		area in two separate waves separated by a few hundred years, around 
		22,300 years ago. At the same time the other half of the Douxcan 
		migrated further east and eventually into the Americas (around 22,000 
		BP). I call this group the Solutrean 1s, even if they did not have the 
		same France-Iberian expression; they are the same root family and

		are many Cache Blade stashes as the power was well recognized and 
		utilized for shamanic work. The largest of these cache blade sites is 
		the Paulina Lake or Dietz Cache site, which contained over 2130 pieces. 
		All the points of the cache were Obsidian and Dacite except for one 
		which was a butterscotch coloured jasper. Most of these blades are

		carried great distances, together as a collected cache, rather than a 
		piece for a locale hiding spot. Many researchers see the cache blade 
		collections as practical labour saving method of storing. This can be 
		the purpose for some but not all of them. The point shown here proves 
		that it was transported with others and kept in a bundle for a long 
		time. These types of caches are of past shamanic family energies. There 
		is no difference between this cache method and that of painted hand 
		prints on a cave wall. From this Paulina Lake Cache the shamans had 
		access to their ancestor’s energies and their knowledge (from a shamanic 
		side). As an example I was told that with my first blade (shown below) I 
		had access to 500 shamans out of the 2130 blades that were part of this 
		cache. This cache took thousands of years to collect and I would like to 
		offer one or two of mine to the practising shamans reading this 
		material. I will post one in the upcoming weeks or you can write me. My 
		ideal wish is to keep these blades away from the collectors, as there is

		<span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">My teachers were quick 
		to point out that there are many misconceptions in the current 
		understandings of ancient people. One of these is the need to separate 
		people into different cultures and races. My teachers used the word
		<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Era </b>to describe the 
		differences. An era<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> </b>in any 
		culture is sometimes called a new culture in some academic circles. 
		In other words many so called different cultures (based on excavated 
		material) are nothing more than eras or variants of the same culture due 
		to influx of new ideas or environmental changes. If you look at objects 
		and fashions from the 1920s era you can see there is a huge difference 
		in styles from today. Archeologically, are we a different culture from 
		our fathers or grandfathers time? Some would say yes, but they are 
		assigning a different soul lineage to a family evolution. There is no 
		way to determine accurately from one era to another with utilitarian 
		objects. If you can observe spiritual icons, and the focus around these 
		objects, a clearer picture could be perceived. Also, in this same 
		subject, I have been shown that other than some functionality, the 
		general shape of a projectile point is directly contributed to how a 
		culture sees itself. This is directly proportional to their Soul Group 
		Level and icons from this nonphysical level. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		Last year, Charlotte Beck and Tom Jones, archaeologists at New York&#39;s 
		Hamilton College who study sites in the Great Basin, argued that stemmed 
		and Clovis point technologies were separate, with the stemmed points 
		originating from Pacific Coast populations and not, as conventional 
		wisdom holds, from the Clovis people who moved westward from the Great 
		Plains. Erlandson and colleagues noted that the Channel Island points 
		are also broadly similar to stemmed points found early sites around the 
		Pacific Rim, from Japan to South America.<o:p></o:p></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">The genome sequence of a 24,000-year-old Siberian individual has provided a key piece of the puzzle in the quest for Native American origins. The ancient Siberian demonstrates genomic signatures that are basal to present-day western Eurasians and close to modern Native Americans. This surprising finding has great consequences for our understanding of how and from where ancestral Native Americans descended, and also of the genetic landscape of Eurasia 24,000 years ago. The breakthrough is reported in this week&#39;s <i>Nature</i> (Advance Online Publication) by an international team of scientists, led by the Centre for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark (University of Copenhagen). <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">The search for Native American ancestors has been focused in northeastern Eurasia. In late 2009, researchers sampled at the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg the remains of a juvenile individual (MA-1) from the Upper Palaeolithic site of Mal&#39;ta in south-central Siberia. The MA-1 individual dated to approximately 24,000 years ago. Now, the team reports genomic results from the MA-1 individual which unravel the origins of the First Americans – ancestors of modern-day Native Americans.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">&quot;Representing the oldest anatomically modern human genome reported thus far, the MA-1 individual has provided us with a unique window into the genetic landscape of Siberia some 24,000 years ago&quot;, says Dr. Maanasa Raghavan from the Centre for GeoGenetics and one of the lead authors of the study. &quot;Interestingly, the MA-1 individual shows little to no genetic affinity to modern populations from the region from where he originated - south Siberia.&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">Instead, both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of MA-1 indicate that he was related to modern-day western Eurasians. This result paints a picture of Eurasia 24,000 years ago which is quite different from the present-day context. The genome of MA-1 indicates that prehistoric populations related to modern western Eurasians occupied a wider geographical range into northeast Eurasia than they do today. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left"><span class="style30" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Dual ancestry of Native Americans</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">The most significant finding that the MA-1 genome reveals is its relation to modern Native Americans. This relative of present-day western Eurasians shows close affinity to modern Native Americans, but surprisingly not to East Asians who are regarded as being genetically closely related to Native Americans. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">Furthermore, the team finds evidence that this genetic affinity between MA-1 and Native Americans is mediated by a gene flow event from MA-1 into the First Americans, which can explain between 14-38% of the ancestry of modern Native Americans, with the remainder of the ancestry being derived from East Asians. Supported by numerous reasons against these signatures being caused by contamination from modern DNA sources or from post-Columbian admixture (post 1492 AD), the study concludes that two distinct Old World populations led to the formation of the First American gene pool: one related to modern-day East Asians, and the other a Siberian Upper Palaeolithic population related to modern-day western Eurasians.
<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">&quot;The result came as a complete surprise to us. Who would have thought that present-day Native Americans, who we learned in school derive from East Asians, share recent evolutionary history with contemporary western Eurasians? Even more intriguingly, this happened by gene flow from an ancient population that is so far represented only by the MA-1 individual living some 24,000 years ago&quot;, says Professor Eske Willerslev from the Centre for GeoGenetics who led the study. <o:p></o:p></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">Additionally, results from a second south-central Siberian from Afontova Gora-2 site are presented in order to address human occupation of the region during and after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ca. 26,000 to 19,000 years ago), a climatically cold period when glacial ice sheets extended to their maximum range. At approximately 17,000 years ago, this post-LGM individual demonstrates similar genomic signatures as MA-1, with close affinity to modern western Eurasians and Native Americans and none to present-day East Asians. This result indicates that genetic continuity persisted in south-central Siberia throughout this climatically harsh period, which is a significant consideration for the peopling of Beringia, and eventually the Americas some 15,000 years ago. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">Dr. Pontus Skoglund from Uppsala University, and one of the lead authors of the study, explains, &quot;Most scientists have believed that Native American lineages go back about 14,000 years ago, when the first people crossed Beringia into the New World. Our results provide direct evidence that some of the ancestry that characterizes Native Americans is at least 10,000 years older than that, and was already present in Siberia before the last Ice Age.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">Professor Kelly Graf from the Center for the Study of the First Americans (Texas A&amp;M University), who together with Professor Willerslev did the sampling, adds, &quot;Our findings are significant at two levels. First, it shows that Upper Paleolithic Siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern humans that spread out of Africa to Europe and Central and South Asia. Second, Paleoindian skeletons with phenotypic traits atypical of modern-day Native Americans can be explained as having a direct historical connection to Upper Paleolithic Siberia.&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #808080; text-align: left;">As such, results from this study contribute a major leap forward for resolving the peopling of the Americas. <o:p></o:p>
