		specific powers or abilities. No two sites are the same and no site will 
		have the abilities or strengths of a site that may be only a few yards 
		away from its location. Each site is specific to its angular connections 
		and to what prior work was performed there. The expressions of work 
		performed at a sacred site will still be there as an overlay energy. An 
		example of this is entering a sacred site that was used and designed to

		Many people practise meditation using body positions called mudras. 
		Mudras are unique body positions usually involving gestures with hands, 
		fingers, and arms. Extending this to the rest of the body it is known as 
		Yoga and Tai Chi. They all work by connecting the exercise to specific 
		energy angles. Unfortunately half of the benefits and usefulness of the 
		experience has been lost in history. Randomly doing yoga or a mudra 
		without being conscious of the directions or what energies are being 
		connected to is inefficient and sometimes a waste of effort. Just as one 
		knows in a yoga position that proper body alignment is crucial, so too 
		is the proper alignment to sources energies. Full efficiency of any 
		posture is never gained without this complete and full alignment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		This applies to whether one is in a vortex area or not. Mudras can be 
		extremely powerful, if used with the proper angles associated with the 
		universal structure. Every position that a body operates in throughout 
		the day connects its vitality or life support to its energy sources. The 
		energy of one’s higher consciousness runs through thousands of energy 
		strings that originate and are facilitated by the universal structure. 
		As described above all energy in the universe runs along specific angles 
		and structures. This includes the designer itself, consciousness. Facing 
		the proper direction and utilising the appropriate mudras or yogic 
		positions will bring quickness and efficiency in strength to the 
		exercise and desires. Each angle in a mudra or yogic stances is specific 
		in energy that the body is taking in. This is why most of the mudras and 
		yogic positions need revamping with enhanced awareness of directions 
		that one should be facing. The reason I bring this topic up is because 
		shamans at ancient sites were aware of this and applied these 
		understandings to their ceremonies and work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
