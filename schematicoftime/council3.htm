		Council of Stone is a group of shamans that existed in the physical (all 
		in their individual times) but reside in council as a group, in the 
		nonphysical reality. This reality is just above or below the physical 
		“horizon”, some refer to this as the astral level. This council works 
		through the sacred site system throughout North America (They are also 
		capable of reaching sites outside of the continent). All sacred sites 
		are “switchboards” connecting to other sites and the shamans from those 
		areas, the “ancient internet” if you will. They are not an organized 
		group nor do they function under an archetypical hierarchy. They are 
		organized as all of us are (physical or not) into layers of 
		consciousness. Connecting or joining is just a matter of having like 
		vibration and desires. You may ask;
		<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

		<span class="style4">It is possible because we all come from the same 
		Soul Groups (five main ones for this Earth time period of reality). 
		Connecting to each other in the nonphysical is the easiest part, knowing 
		how to from the physical level is the lesson that needs to be learnt. 
		One further note; the councils do not all work on the same projects, 
		levels, or purposes. Their individual interests and desires separate 
		them as magnets separate or draw together like kinds within their wave 
		field strengths.</span><span class="style4" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

		More advanced information on time, space, DNA, atomic structure, and so

		the time/resources to accomplish this). I have also been instructed not 
		to share any of the advanced material until a complete understanding can 
		be presented first. The reason behind this is so that it doesn’t allow 
		misinterpretation of partial teachings to fall into the hands of certain 
		groups that like to support their own pet theories. New technologies are 
		possible with this information but if the background understanding is 
		not understood improper usage can follow, as has been witnessed in our

		from this level of conscious construct. The artifact is a product of 
		many levels of “common ground” consciousness that created it (stone, 
		human, and so on). This common ground in Earth reality is called a time 
		period in our understanding. Time periods are thus periods or cycles in 
		which many have combined in a balancing co-creation to form the stone, 
		metal, shape, desired tool, and so on for the artifact’s existence to

		<em>Attuning to an artifacts vibrational and creational moment (the 
		beginning of its physical existence) is tapping into the moment of that 
		cycle of time (and conscious desire) that took place. All this has 
		limits, as bridges in time or cycles need to be in alignment if you are 
		to venture out of your present vibrational level. What this actually 
		means is that you need to bond with new levels of consciousness, and 
		they may not necessarily be familiar to you. This can be done outside of 
		the present physical mind level, but cycles need to be observed or steps 
		taken to get there. In other words there are barriers or levels of 
		consciousness that need to be bridged. More discipline and focus in 
		letting go is one of the prime ingredients for this work. The artifact 
		is another and the acceptance of a different mode of thinking or 
		perceiving is the third. To go back 30,000 years, you would do well to 
		use later artifacts as bridges between and to the periods. Not much 
		thought should be put into this as it is automatic, if you are aligned 
		and open. </em> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<em>Artifacts are not just here to teach of past cultures or who these 
		people were; they are here also to teach the possibilities of a whole 
		realm of human conscious ability. The ultimate understanding of a master 
		mystic is the realization that one is studying human consciousness on 
		all levels, angles, and flavours. This level of mysticism understands 
		that there are no secrets or unknowns in the human form. All is 
		accessible once the bridges are made and the levels understood. This is 
		the new cycle of development as it brings completion to the Earth bound 
		human creative experience. This has been the ultimate goal of 
		humanity from its conceptions. The difference today as compared to 
		yesterday can be witnessed in the new levels of awareness!</em><o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<em>To go into the future one also needs an artifact, but this has not 
		been created in the present time cycle so there is a need to connect to 
		artifacts of consciousness. With the past and present understandings of 
		how human consciousness creates and understands its creations, one can 
		access the future, as this too is in a cyclic form that one has yet to 
		recognize in the present. Recognizing the future or the past in the 
		“now” is the same with the only difference being the boundaries of 
		cyclic understandings that one places upon oneself. Understanding that 
		no boundaries exist is an exercise in recognition of other forms of 
		human consciousness. This is being provided by ones current physical 
		artifacts as they assist a shaman to go beyond their current “present”. 
		Going into the future can be done by bridging the boundaries of cyclic 
		creation. Thus, as with the past, you will need to bridge time cycles 
		and this can be accomplished through the Soul Group level, ones higher 
		vibratory states. This is not always achievable unless there is a 
		vibratory pedigree in the first place. There are many that cannot do 
		this due to their underdeveloped connection to Soul Level. </em> <o:p></o:p>
