		Working at Ancient Sites<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		The ancient structures were built as collectors of energy that allowed 
		shamans to enhance their abilities and experiences. This was 
		accomplished through knowledge of the universal structure in conjunction 
		with the geographic locations. These structure or “machines” made it 
		easier to attract and store the avenues of choice. Creation in the 
		physical is a combination of energies. At these sites one can focus 
		specifically at one part (angle) or use multiple points of focus. There 
		are no rules per se but one must understand the general purpose of the 
		angles. As shown in prior chapters there is a time orientated structure 
		at all sites built on vortex areas. Facing the direction of choice is 
		important and with this the correlating desire for experience. 
		Efficiency (quickness in time) is a result of desire aligned with 
		spiritual connection and physical positioning. Generally circle sites 
		are more oriented to higher vibratory states while square and triangular 
		are more physical creators. Pyramids are machines that focused in three 
		dimensional alignments with the same angle. This could include journeys 
		(contacting to physicals outside this reality), power of creation in the 
		physical, physical based knowledge, and so on. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		Remember this reality’s present position and to a future focus is angled 
		at approximately 51- 55 degrees. This is why many ancient sites are 
		aligned to these 50ish angles. Using a 3 dimensional sphere as one’s 
		compass, see the angles that apply. The opposite angles of 234 degrees 
		(of 52) shows the way to our past. Both angles represent the physical 
		connective angle but the 234ish angles are the past physical and one’s 
		foundation in their physical. Family ancestors are along this back 
		angle. Focusing to the elemental or animal guardians would be found in 
		the range of 120 - 135 degrees. Going deeper into the lower vibrational 
		levels would take you to the Dorajuadoik level of 160 + or -. Tilting 
		any angle sideways or up and down (3D) will result in variations of this 
		energy so one must experiment or rely on intuition to fine tune this. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		This is the biggest problem with ancient sites. Their angular structure 
		is typically set up with alignments of past earth processional tilts. 
		Unless a complete time cycle has taken place the structure is typically 
		out of sync with our present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span>Higher vibratory site structure should be aligned to 0 degrees 
		and this is why some sites are presently at 12 – 15 degrees off north 
		(processional shift). In this modern time period the benefit of working 
		at ancients sites is not in the site itself (unless researching past 
		shamanic understandings) but in the general area. Typically the main 
		vortex area has moved over to the side and out of the archeological site 
		itself. With this understanding one can comfortably create their own 
		site without disturbing any archaeology or energy of the site. Dowsing 
		rods or pendulum can help in finding this new vortex position. <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		Dating the site can be calculated by this deviation, assuming it has not cycled around a couple of times. If a site goes back too far there is another angular problem that is present but its subject is too big for this book. Here is a link to its direction if you curious:</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfBSc6e7QQ&amp;list=PLeKpxjfIGPp0ITbLO_ZYGr4RkjN7honJO"><span class="style18" style="line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfBSc6e7QQ&amp;list=PLeKpxjfIGPp0ITbLO_ZYGr4RkjN7honJO</span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		The best thing I can say is to experiment and experience it yourself. 
		This is because everyone will have different results depending on their 
		awareness level, and desires. Also remember that because of the 
		differences between the sites and one’s own process there could be 
		immediate results or it may take weeks to see any changes. This is one 
		of the most important things to understand. Like all evolution of spirit 
		one must be ready for change. If one is not ready to change do not 
		expect instant results. This sounds easy but we hide our fears of 
		change, and so well that most are not even aware we have any.

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; height: 111px;">
		Don’t forget that this is also based on a 3D sphere, with one in the 
		center of it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The angle’s in this 
		sphere can be seen as “rings” or hoops of energy around the sphere. In 
		my teachings they never referred to the opposite degrees of an angle as 
		its numerical extension. So 53 is 53 degrees all the way around the 
		sphere. 45s and 90s are the same with the only difference is the axis 
		position of 0 and 180 degrees (see diagram below). There is so much 
		around this subject and it gets very complicated but the purpose of this 
		text is to introduce people to this lost understanding. <o:p></o:p></p>

		Standing in a vortex or an ancient site (assuming the site’s energy has 
		not shifted) true north would be “0” degrees at the horizon, in front of

		highest vibrational level. Arching backward behind one’s body, on this 
		same latitude, is going back into the present physical <u>body’s 
		spiritual past</u>. The further back the angle the deeper back in time

		these 50ish degrees in pyramids.) Swinging up on this same longitude 
		angle to our crown is the highest vibrational (spiritual) level for our
		<u>present physical existence</u>. Swinging backwards past our crown 
		takes us back in time of this present lifetime. Continuing the sweep 
		backwards and below the horizon (on this 50ish angle) is a <u>connection

		Time has to be addressed as it one of the main components of the “power” 
		that sacred sites have. It is the time factor above all that produces 
		the most dramatic results. Other than the obvious measurement of events, 
		from a shaman’s view, time can be observed as structure. The biggest 
		problem describing the time aspect is the number of views or properties 
		that can be focused on. Time has a distinctive pattern and a schematic. 
		How we see this pattern depends on what level or angle of the structure 
		we are looking at. At one point we see a grid, another ratcheting 
		spheres or cubes, and at another level moving structures that spiral. It 
		can also be sequential patch works or pockets of time displacement 
		interacting with one another. It is all the same structure and it is all 
		the same movement, just different aspects of the whole creation. The 
		duration of time can also vary from one dimensional level to another

		predispositions. Choice is not always a matter of what but rather what 
		is capable, within a particular vibrational signature at hand. The time 
		aspect spirals due to movement in the fabric of creation. This spiraling 
		is relevant to the desired “direction” which could be up, down, or in 
		some cases to the side. It all depending on the original position of

		Universal Structure. To the Maya the “calendar” was a schematic route

		Reality can be likened to this shallow flowing river. As water flows; 
		rocks, sand, and their arrangement are set into patterns that suites the 
		current. The speed will determine what gets placed into its position on 
		the river bed. This environment maintains its stability as long as the 
		flow maintains its volume and speed. With more or less volume it creates 
		a different flow pattern. As a tree falls from the bank into the river 
		it creates a new flow pattern. The third sphere ratchet into the 
		balanced state of the lattice is the falling tree. Along with this are 
		the different angles that the tree could land in the stream. One 
		pointing up stream will have a greater influence than a downstream 
		placement. This is the nature of all energy angular placements. As far 
		as the vehicle that left the tracks it only created a ripple in the 
		river’s flow. The “tracks” left behind are the only thing left of this 
		event. Similarly, the ancient site’s ripple is gone, but the site’s 
		“tracks” are still here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>

		The angles are thus the determining factor to time flow of energy. As a 
		cycle goes through its course it is obviously influenced by different 
		intersecting energy flows. This is why the cycle is never static but 
		becomes an expression of all the intersecting energies in the flow. The 
		end of the cycle is thus a point where the flow has matched its momentum 
		or balance, at which point larger cycles start the flow again. The end 
		of the cycle means that the original flow has gone through its 
		“experience” with other influences and is now back to the beginning. The 
		completion is a reference point. As larger cycles are still within their 
		movement they now influence this null point of reference to create 
		another fork in the road. The cycle is never the same as the last one 
		because the larger cycles influence is at a different level of the 
		smaller cycles. <o:p></o:p></p>

		described as a three dimensional projection similar to a hologram. She 
		hesitated, thinking she would be unable to accurately depict the 
		three-dimensional quality of the map she says she saw on the ship. 
		Eventually, however, she did what Simon suggested. Although she said the 
		map had many stars, she drew only those that stood out in her memory. 
		Her map consisted of twelve prominent stars connected by lines and three 
		lesser ones that formed a distinctive triangle. (see below) She said she 
		was told the stars connected by solid lines formed &quot;trade routes&quot;, 
		whereas dashed lines were to less-traveled stars.<o:p></o:p></p>
