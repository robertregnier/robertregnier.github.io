		In my opinion the best sources to learn how to have an “OBE” (Out of 
		Body Experience – a journey) is through the Monroe Institute’s 
		teachings, Robert Bruce’s instructions, or the drumming methods taught

		As said prior, I will not repeat what others have already taught but I 
		will introduce more specifics for dialling into the realms of the past 
		and its personalities. As you can imagine there has to be a co-creation 
		here as nothing in the universe is a singular motion. Balance must be 
		part of every universal flow, and in this case we are richer from the 
		contact experience as the past is for its future experience. When 
		connecting to the past and the resident individuals’ assonated there, be 
		it spiritual or physical, one must understand that they too are 
		experiencing your connection. This experience could take place in as 
		many ways as there are individuals with whom to make contact. This 
		includes perceiving you - one way or another, crossing paths in time 
		journeys, and even in the dream state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		One of the most important things to remember when doing this work is 
		cleanliness and the need to eliminate any sticky vibration that is not 
		ours. This includes the energies that we collect during our day from 
		others to artificial smells like strong smelling shampoos and hair 
		conditioners. This sounds like a typical New Age belief system but it is 
		not, as many shamans in the past also understood the preference from the 
		other side. A clean energetic body helps in this work. It will not stop 
		the process, but purity of vibration is an advantage. A shower cleans 
		the energy of the day away just as Sweat Lodges have a purpose if a 
		ritual bath is not possible. (There is more to a Sweat Lodge than this, 
		but that is for another time.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		Many advanced shamans experience a transformation into animal form to do 
		their work. The experience is so real there would be no benefit in 
		trying to convince them otherwise. The more grounded we are in the 
		physical the more we will have a tendency to need physical reality 
		symbols to assist with the experience. This is because to some, the OBE 
		experiences does not correspond to how they see the physical world. So 
		if we find ourselves flying in a journey (knowing full well we don’t 
		have feathers) some of us prefer to create the mechanism that is capable 
		of flight, and that is a bird. They will either co-create with a living 
		one (melding consciousnesses) or see ourselves turn into one. This is 
		completely real for those that have the ability to go Out of Body and 
		still need to be attached to the physical world. There is also nothing 
		wrong with this as it is just an expression, like everything else in 
		life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		All material has a vibrational flavour that is very specific to the form 
		regardless of how similar the forms may look. To use different materials 
		as tools, you first have to be accomplished at sensing their energy and 
		vibrational level. Connecting to a feather is connecting to the bird’s 
		spiritual vibration and its abilities to create physical flight in this 
		reality. This is a powerful way to connect to the bird’s conscious 
		ability to soar (starts in nonphysical) for there are no boundaries to 
		conscious connections, unless the difference is extreme. In this case 
		the connection will be limited in its experience. Connecting to this 
		level of spirituality becomes an individual experience for we are 
		working on levels outside the physical. This is also why shamans and the 
		ancients wore feathers and other animal parts, as these are energetic 
		keys to unlock doors and avenues into awareness levels not possessed by 
		humans. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span class="style2">Connecting to any animal through its spiritual 
		aspect is also a channel into its strengths and as explained earlier, 
		after all this is the realm that gives birth to its physical form. This 
		is understood by all shamans in past and present cultures as the 
		animal’s strength and power can be adopted, in nonphysical levels. As 
		shamans we can use this knowledge to advance our abilities. This 
		includes connecting to the one of the lowest vibratory worlds of the 
		snake vibration. This level is a step away from the Dorajuadoik and the 
		answer to why some cultures saw the snake as a symbol of power. </span>

		subconscious constructs of human consciousness in mass (a global human 
		archetypical creation). This is a very real construct but has no 
		validity for those that are not feeding from this supported creation. It 
		is similar to many past “Gods” created by ancient cultures. These Gods 
		did exist and were not just statues on alters. For these people the Gods 
		did have power as they were allowed this power by the ones that 
		supported belief in them. This power is the power of the human 
		consciousness in mass numbers (in this reality we are gods). These god 
		constructs are still out there in the ethers, but with little to no

		On the nonphysical levels of teaching: Shamans that use or need drugs to 
		assist them in their journeys will be limited to the vibration of the 
		drug itself. Although it is true that one drug may be of a higher 
		vibration than another it is also true that a drug will have slightly 
		different effects on different individuals. The fact is, individual 
		shamans will also have different vibratory levels in this physical 
		plane. My reference to drugs is strictly with natural or plant 
		hallucinogens. It is not commonly known, even in the metaphysical world, 
		but plants like humans can be of different vibrational levels. There are 
		individual plants (I’m not referring to species here) that are of a 
		higher vibration than some humans. There are also parts of every plant 
		that vibrate at different levels. The compounds that result in 
		hallucinogenic effects in the humans are of these higher vibrations. All 
		of this is relevant to the individuals vibratory level, and that of the 
		vibrational level of the drug itself. Their vibration co-mixes with the 
		vibration of the plant hallucinogen. With some people this can also 
		lower their vibration, giving way to unpleasant experiences. <o:p></o:p>

		<span class="style2" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="style2">Compounding 
		this with individual fears and beliefs it gets very complicated but very 
		diverse. Every person has a different level of vibration. But this can 
		also vary throughout their individual lives, and at times throughout the 
		year, even during a single day. Enhancing an individual OBE experience 
		with a drug can go in either direction. The drug will always be a 
		temporary rise or lowering, for to completely maintain a vibrational 
		level you must become it. </span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #C0C0C0;">
		An individual’s vibration is a combination of their earthly physical 
		form and their spiritual “soul source”. What the drug will do is magnify 
		the expression of the individual’s vibration, fears, beliefs and needs 
		(conscious or not). This also happens in the nonphysical realities 
		without drug induction. In the physical you create the world you know. 
		In the non-physical realms you create it without time, so your fears 
		will be manifested immediately, but the combination of the two can run 
		wild in any direction. Harmonic resonance maintains individual realties 
		into their respected vibrational states. This is part of the universal 
		“filter system”, that keeps without divine impute, people to their 
		individual experiential levels, no matter what dimension they journey 
		into. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #C0C0C0;">
		Each dimension will have its own spectrum of vibrational levels that 
		compose that individual level or dimension. But if the specific 
		dimension’s lowest vibrational layer is still too high for you, then you 
		will not be able to resonate with it. You may experience a brief 
		“visit”, which is exactly what happens with many profound mystical 
		experiences. They are usually one of a kind and cannot be maintained or 
		held because the individual can’t sustain a vibration that is not them. 
		So how do I manage to journey into vibrational fields that I cannot come 
		close to in this human conscious form? It is very simple and yet takes 
		many years to complete. By completion I mean a balanced state of being. 
		To arrive at a balanced state takes years of personal “housecleaning” 
		and reorganizing of your beliefs. Housecleaning is clearing all that is 
		in conflict, with expectations, fears, past hurts, and so on all acting 
		on your vibrational field to keep it in a lower state. It is a huge 
		topic and there are many self-help books on the market, but I think you 
		get the picture. As you get closer to clearing all from this life you 
		will inevitably start to stray into prior lives and levels for more 
		clearing. With each level cleared a new level of connection will be 
		gained and a new sustained higher vibration. <o:p></o:p></p>

		designed in different shapes for different levels of shamans (see 
		pictures below). This knowledge was not for the general populace as it 
		was guarded among the best shamans, like most of their other 
		understandings. There were many secret societies in North American 
		cultures that will never come to light. A good example of this was 
		witnessed by an early eastern European explorer. While visiting an 
		Eastern native village he witnessed how the general members of the tribe
