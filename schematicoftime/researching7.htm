		With just showing the outer shell of the three you can clearly see how 
		the patches and the central Patch Head is created. With more inner 
		shells replicating the outer ones it creates a multi shelled patch head. 
		The outer sphere’s strings create shells with their crossing of each 
		other. These new patch head shells create the outer and inner dimensions 
		of the patch. Remember, these strings are dual flowing energy helixes, 
		which are now converging into one area of common ground. (What are not 
		shown in the above diagrams are the many inner spheres of the three, as 
		described prior). With the other sphere shells included they would 
		create patches within patches called Patch Shells. The spheres are 
		moving energy that gives the illusion of “rotating” energy and this 
		rotating energy carries on into the patches. So as three spheres rotate 
		into one another you have spiraling vortexes of energy that create the

		material in a couple of generations, and the introductions should 
		continue as a prep until this time. What is the most impressive part of 
		Walter’s work is his outlining of the element stages. It is because of 
		his extensive work into the “periodic table” that I have not bothered to 
		go any further than this introduction, which has some variants to or 
		additions to his material. The main difference is that Walter did not 
		see the 45 connection or he just decided to ignore it for simplicities 
		sakes. It could also be a case (which I was told) that it all comes down

		Keeping in mind all that has been introduced in the prior sections there 
		are two things one must keep in focus. The first one is that the basic 
		background structure remains intact regardless of its size or movement, 
		and with this is a repeated design throughout the dimensions, from the 
		atomic level to a galaxy. Along with this, remember that even the most 
		complex patterns will have this underling basic support structure. This 
		would be cube/sphere, spiralling ribbon, and so on, for they are always 
		in the background, even if the creation is in a different dimensional 
		level or size. The second thing to keep in mind is that patterns evolve 
		into more complex forms as the harmonics shift into complexity. The 
		bottom line; complexity cannot exist without the basic tones that gave 
		rise to its creation. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

		In the last diagram (above) I have created a representation of the main 
		energy flows connected to the 45-degree axis. When combing the above 
		sections of “45” and “The Ratchet” the result produces the 45-degree 
		axis. This duel helix of 45-degree energy flows (8 in number) into and 
		out of the core of the cube/sphere, passing through the octahedron 
		shells (residing on a different level). As magnetic flow enters the 
		cube/sphere structure from its core the opposite balancing flow of 
		electric energy is ejected from the 8 corners back into the cube’s core.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span>Both electric and magnetic enter and exit from different 
		dimensional structures but are still the same energy. Their difference 
		is a product of their exit points. That being the sphere’s center and 
		the cube’s corners. The energy is the same level but inner dimensions of 
		the sphere, as compared to the cube will have different interpretations 
		of this energy. In the physical level it is expressed at the 45-degree 
		horizons, from sphere core horizon moving up through the different 
		horizons the energy is expressed as magnetic. The opposite expression 
		comes from energy flowing via cube corners and exiting into the core of 
		the sphere’s horizon. In the physical structures this results in 
		magnetic flow expanding outward (radiation) and electric flow 
		compressing inward to the core (gravity).</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;

		All energy flows are “filtered” by the event horizons regardless of 
		their level and angle. As explained in prior chapters, the octahedron 
		has shells and each of its 8 facets or sides will be composed of stacked 
		layers or bands of different harmonic octahedrons. Octahedron inside 
		octahedron, with all of them deriving their creation from the original 8 
		pack and its layered shells. Each of these octahedron shells will have 
		their unique flavour and thus a specialized “filter”, as compared to its 
		neighbours. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

		With each facet of the octahedron having aspects from its parent spheres 
		(from the 8 pack) the 8 different electromagnetic flows become 
		individuals from one another. Each of these 8 electromagnetic flows 
		encountering “interference” at the spinning horizons creating a looping 
		effect in their flows that resembles a figure 8 pattern. <o:p></o:p>

		Like the main 0-180 axis the spiralling ribbons of the opposing 
		45-degree flows create figure 8 loops of energy at the octahedron 
		horizons. However, this time the 45 axis flow differs from the main 
		event horizon as it belongs to the physical level. The flow of the main 
		0-180 has no physical level capacity but in the electromagnetic angle, 
		the physical elements are the product of interaction with the octahedron 
		shells. That is if all of it falls within the perfect balance with 
		underlying energies and structures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
