		I have been told that the dot diagrams in the Iberian/French caves are 
		representations of water. Ancient humans looked out across the lakes and 
		oceans seeing vast expanses of water. What impressed them the most was 
		the sparkling glints of light patterns that waves and sun create. These 
		“diamonds” on the surface became magical to them as they defied 
		explanation and had no corporeal existence. To them water was also an 
		impassable barrier that only certain animals had the capacity to enter. 
		Magic, water, and these certain animals became symbols of spiritual 
		power and awe. Shamans recognized both light and the fact that bodies of 
		water were a different form of reality. With this view of water their 
		symbolic representations became “polka dots of light”. <o:p></o:p>

		In the above pictograph from the El Castillo Cave is a good example of 
		this understanding. The dots are rivers of water and on these rivers are 
		hide stretched boats, obviously a powerful impression to be recorded and 
		talked about in a legend. You can see on the right side there is a boat 
		on the water, as the water is covered by the rear part of the boat. The 
		boat sits on the water covering the area that it occupies, from that 
		perspective. The object above this boat it is a sail full of wind, but 
		not fully recognized by the observer as to how it is attached to the 
		boat. There is a start of a mast in the middle of the boat but time has 
		erased it or it was never recognized and recorded. Both the boat and the 
		sails are stitched together with more than one piece of hide. In fact 
		the gunwale (gunnel) can also be seen with more stitching as it is an 
		attachment area to the wood frame. You can also see on the left boat the 
		middle section had two smaller hides sown together, showing there was 
		more than one boat being observed. </span>

		resemblances between the word and its referent. Thus fish becomes

		March 20, 2012 - a letter from a intelligent and open minded reader, he

		&quot;My search<a name="_GoBack"></a> of the Net for info. re. the boats of 
		the Solutrean brought me to your site. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium">
		The cave-art that you show from El Castillo is very interesting. It 
		seems to me that the hypothesised sail is problematic in that it goes 
		against all that I understand about maritime history, as this would mean 
		the invention of the sail thousands of years earlier than generally 
		accepted.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium">
		On the other hand, there is something shown by the Castilo pictographs 
		that you may not have considered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span>Various works by Alessandra Nibbi attest what she regards as 
		skin-boats in Pre-Dynastic/Early Dynastic Egypt. Paul Johnstone (The 
		Sea-craft of Prehistory 1980) cites an earlier French boat describing 
		shows more of the same in Ireland. He also published photographs of the 
		same in Norway and Canada plus carvings on rocks in Norway.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium">
		The feature held in common by these vessels is the showing of ribs of 
		skin-boats that with the sun behind them make them almost glass-like. It 
		did occur to me that this may be what is shown by the Castillo cave-art. 
		This in turn feeds into the argued-for case of the Solutreans were 
		capable of taking skin-boats along the northern edge of Late Pleistocene 
		ice en route to East-coast Americas.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium">
		In closing, whether of the Celto/Irish currach or the umiak plus kaiak/kayak 
		of the Inuit/Eskimoes, it made me wondered if the glass-like vessels lie 
		behind such as the tales of the Irish Celts about glass boats or of the 
		Amerinds called the Maya and their legend of their god named Kukulkan (= 
		the Quetzacoatl of the Nahual [esp. the Aztecs]) sailing back to his 
		homeland on a snakeskin vessel.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium">
		Also according to The Making of Egypt by Flinders Petrie (1939) and The 
		Riddle of Prehistoric Britain (1994 by Comyns Beaumont, there are 
		Solutrean affinities of stonework in Egypt &amp; Britain.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium">
		Your mention of the dots around the possible boats that may represent 
		dappled water set me thinking about how this may be shown by modern 
		painters. A good article was on the Edward Tufte forum.</p>
