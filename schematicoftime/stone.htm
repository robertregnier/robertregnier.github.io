		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; " class="style4">don’t put 
		much faith in psychic information simply because of the level of 
		vibration that it is extracted from. Psychic information is usually 
		associated with the physical or “near physical realms” (referred to as 
		the Astral Level). Because this energy comes from areas so close to the 
		physical the information itself is usually influence or changed by 
		contact with the our conscious level. There are times that it can be 
		valuable but personally I would still place the information in the 
		entertainment field because of its susceptibility. Any information that 
		has forecasting properties will have the same reliability as flipping a 
		coin. </span> </p>
		<p class="style4">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style4">The further you are personally removed from any 
		information (on psychic levels) the more accurate it will be. &nbsp;The 
		distant past is a perfect example, for it gives us a window into the 
		energies of other realities. It should also be understood that there is 
		a limit to how distant in time you can go with any accuracy using this 
		source. The reason for this can be shown in the structure of time itself 
		(To be revealed in “The Schematic of Ti<span class="style75">m</span>e”). Below is an experiment I did 
		with the intent of entertaining possibilities in time. This took place 
		in 2002 on a trip to the West Coast of Canada. Two ancient native sites 
		and one grave marker were visited. My method is to allow myself to be 
		drawn to a stone on the ground, pick it up with the left hand, and then 
		download the latent energies in the stone (in a meditative state). I 
		also try to find interesting stones, ones that look like tool making 
		material or ones that have been altered. </p>

		St. Victor Petroglyphs - This stone told a story about an elderly native 
		woman that related to the site so much that she chose this place to be 
		her last memory here on earth. - She was known as a shaman but in the 
		healing arts only. She let others do the sacred teachings. - She tried 
		marriage but it was impossible to stay together without “killing each 
		other”. - Age was becoming a big problem with her. This centered on the 
		lack of teeth and the cold winters. - It was late fall and a time to 
		make a decision on whether to go on or not. The summer foods were 
		possible to consume but the winter dried and frozen foods had become a 
		difficult chore. She felt that one more winter was not necessary. - The 
		cliff area was well known for its healing and vision abilities and was 
		her personal healing spot. She felt this spot was the closest to her 
		spiritual source. - She was quite comfortable with the idea of death and 
		saw no judgment in the act of suicide. After a day's refection on life 
		she walked over to the eastern cliff area and &quot;fell&quot; off the edge. - Her 
		family found her later that day. - This spot was her favourite place and 
		still has a part of her residing there today. This is not in torment but 
		in connection and service to others. If you desire her help spend as 
		much time there as you can for the connection will be more effective.

		or by lack of instructions). - This one is not a good candidate for 
		spiritual work. - The spiritual problem goes back into many former 
		lifetimes. – Reasons unknown? (This is a good example of the singular 
		level in which psychic energy operates in) – Part of his present life 
		problem was his disinterest in the ancient teachings. - He does remember 
		the connection to animal spirits but is a little “fuzzy” on the subject. 
		- The stone drill was used to carve an animal totem. This was done in 
		sandstone or bone - not clear on this - was not wood. - He is not having 
		a good time here so he decided that a totem animal could help connect 
		him in his vision quest. – Again, he did not belong there for it was not 
		his forte. - He cannot go back to the camp for a few days and this 
		irritated him even more. – His age is somewhere between 12 and 16. - He 
		knew that it was important to make a spiritual connection. Achieving the 
		connection was important in becoming a hunter or brave, for this would 
		be recognized and accepted by the others in the tribe. - He knew faking

		historically (knew unconsciously his graffiti would be preserved here). 
		- He also knew that it was not proper to write on the stone cliffs but 
		did so anyway. - He wanted to get ahead in life. - In his mind this was 
		his land or property and wanted to demonstrate it to the natives present 
		or past. - The stone I picked up was used to carve a date or deface the 
		site.</span></p>

		<p class="style4"><b><span lang="EN-CA">Stone – 4</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> 
		- St. Victor Petroglyphs – The last stone was a surprise. I could feel something very powerful happening when I picked it up. I was on top on the site in the middle of the meadow area (see picture below). This must have been the ceremony area for shamanic work. There is definitely a 
		vortex of energy circle that is about eight feet in diameter.&nbsp; After 
		many visits to ancient sites and over the years of integrating this 
		energy you get a feel for the areas that are the strongest. I had not 
		told my partner of my earlier connections so it was an opportunity test 
		the validity my new information. Handing her the stone I had just picked 
		was my way of saying you can go first. This is something I would not 
		normally do for it risks contaminating the object with the other 
		person’s energy. After a brief mediation with the stone she looked up at 
		me and said “<i>I had a vision of an old native woman's face”</i> (I had 
		not yet told her of my earlier connections). </span></p>
		<p class="style4"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="style4"><span lang="EN-CA">Receiving the stone back from 
		her I took my turn in the vortex field. To my disappointment I could not 
		connect to any of the site’s past but instead the energy took my far 
		past the physical level. In hindsight I should have known this. - I was 
		informed that the information on my grid work was good. – From there I 
		began having visions of vesica piscis shaped energy that crossed at top 
		and bottom, then radiating out to different grid shapes. – I was told 
		there is a consciousness at every energy level of creation. It is 
		compete unto its own. - The bigger the circle the bigger the event 
		horizon. - To find power spots shamans would see them in their journeys 
		or they would be told were to look. When they were back from their 
		journey they would be aware of the signature energy and know when they 
		had found the spot. - Some were also found by accident by just being 
		very sensitive to the energy differences in the environment. </span></p>

		of events to come. - The time period he is living in is good with lots 
		of the necessities of life being available. He has a poetic mind and 
		expresses life through personal poetry. - He was inspired by the great 
		view from the site which gave him an incredible feeling of joy for life, 
		no anxiety or worries about anything. - There are fleeting thoughts 
		about the ceremony to come and the opportunity to meet new females from 
		other areas. - He was picking up stones and rocks to finish the medicine 
		wheel when this stone (fist size) caught his eye. It was made of 
		quartzite and possible tool making material. He struck it hard twice and 
		on the third time it fractured. This is the stone I picked up. - He was

		kind created harmony in the region. As far as shamans understood, the 
		purpose was to create in collective values what I would call “collective 
		consciousness”, which would guarantee their future. The Majorville 
		location was picked because of the recognized energy there. This place 
		was also energetically connected to other power spots all over North 
		America. Celestial alignments at the sites were strictly for timing, to 
		guarantee mass group origination over large distances. In other words 
		celestial periods were a method of timing or determining a date for 
		those spread across the land. This site also has an association with the 
		Sundial Site to the south-west. </span></p>

		as much time in at these sites as you can. In time your vibration will 
		mesh with the sites, and the information-energy will come in very 
		easily. These people from the past were very powerful and knowledgeable. 
		They spent their lifetimes at these sites as shamans contacting 
		“nonordinary realities”.<font color="#FF3300"> Appling any “modern”

		thousands of years to accumulate. Spend as much time there and always in 
		silence, after all how else can you hear!</font></span></span></p>
