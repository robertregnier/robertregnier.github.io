		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">don’t put 
		much faith in psychic information simply because of the level of 
		vibration that it is extracted from. Psychic information is usually 
		associated with the physical or “near physical realms” (referred to as 
		the Astral Level). Because this energy comes from areas so close to the 
		physical the information itself is usually influence or changed by 
		contact with the our conscious level. There are times that it can be 
		valuable but personally I would still place the information in the 
		entertainment field because of its susceptibility. Any information that 
		has forecasting properties will have the same reliability as flipping a 
		coin. </span> </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The further you are personally removed from any 
		information (on psychic levels) the more accurate it will be. &nbsp;The 
		distant past is a perfect example, for it gives us a window into the 
		energies of other realities. It should also be understood that there is 
		a limit to how distant in time you can go with any accuracy using this 
		source. The reason for this can be shown in the structure of time itself 
		(To be revealed in “The Schematic of Time”). Below is an experiment I did 
		with the intent of entertaining possibilities in time. This took place 
		in 2002 on a trip to the West Coast of Canada. Two ancient native sites 
		and one grave marker were visited. My method is to allow myself to be 
		drawn to a stone on the ground, pick it up with the left hand, and then 
		download the latent energies in the stone (in a meditative state). I 
		also try to find interesting stones, ones that look like tool making 
		material or ones that have been altered. </p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA">Here are some physic impressions 
		I received from 7 stones at two ancient spiritual sites. These were

		St. Victor Petroglyphs - This stone told a story about an elderly native 
		woman that related to the site so much that she chose this place to be 
		her last memory here on earth. - She was known as a shaman but in the 
		healing arts only. She let others do the sacred teachings. - She tried 
		marriage but it was impossible to stay together without “killing each 
		other”. - Age was becoming a big problem with her. This centered on the 
		lack of teeth and the cold winters. - It was late fall and a time to 
		make a decision on whether to go on or not. The summer foods were 
		possible to consume but the winter dried and frozen foods had become a 
		difficult chore. She felt that one more winter was not necessary. - The 
		cliff area was well known for its healing and vision abilities and was 
		her personal healing spot. She felt this spot was the closest to her 
		spiritual source. - She was quite comfortable with the idea of death and 
		saw no judgment in the act of suicide. After a day's refection on life 
		she walked over to the eastern cliff area and &quot;fell&quot; off the edge. - Her 
		family found her later that day. - This spot was her favourite place and 
		still has a part of her residing there today. This is not in torment but 
		in connection and service to others. If you desire her help spend as 
		much time there as you can for the connection will be more effective.

		or by lack of instructions). - This one is not a good candidate for 
		spiritual work. - The spiritual problem goes back into many former 
		lifetimes. – Reasons unknown? (This is a good example of the singular 
		level in which psychic energy operates in) – Part of his present life 
		problem was his disinterest in the ancient teachings. - He does remember 
		the connection to animal spirits but is a little “fuzzy” on the subject. 
		- The stone drill was used to carve an animal totem. This was done in 
		sandstone or bone - not clear on this - was not wood. - He is not having 
		a good time here so he decided that a totem animal could help connect 
		him in his vision quest. – Again, he did not belong there for it was not 
		his forte. - He cannot go back to the camp for a few days and this 
		irritated him even more. – His age is somewhere between 12 and 16. - He 
		knew that it was important to make a spiritual connection. Achieving the 
		connection was important in becoming a hunter or brave, for this would 
		be recognized and accepted by the others in the tribe. - He knew faking

		- He also knew that it was not proper to write on the stone cliffs but 
		did so anyway. - He wanted to get ahead in life. - In his mind this was

		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-CA">Stone – 4</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> 
		- St. Victor Petroglyphs – The last stone was a surprise. I could feel 
		something very powerful happening when I picked it up. I was on top on 
		the site in the middle of the meadow area (see picture below). This must 
		have been the ceremony area for shamanic work. There is defiantly a 
		vortex of energy circle that is about eight feet in diameter.&nbsp; After 
		many visits to ancient sites and over the years of integrating this 
		energy you get a feel for the areas that are the strongest. I had not 
		told my partner of my earlier connections so it was an opportunity test 
		the validity my new information. Handing her the stone I had just picked 
		was my way of saying you can go first. This is something I would not 
		normally do for it risks contaminating the object with the other 
		person’s energy. After a brief mediation with the stone she looked up at 
		me and said “<i>I had a vision of an old native woman's face”</i> (I had 
		not yet told her of my earlier connections). </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA">Receiving the stone back from 
		her I took my turn in the vortex field. To my disappointment I could not 
		connect to any of the site’s past but instead the energy took my far 
		past the physical level. In hindsight I should have known this. - I was 
		informed that the information on my grid work was good. – From there I 
		began having visions of vesica piscis shaped energy that crossed at top 
		and bottom, then radiating out to different grid shapes. – I was told 
		there is a consciousness at every energy level of creation. It is 
		compete unto its own. - The bigger the circle the bigger the event 
		horizon. - To find power spots shamans would see them in their journeys 
		or they would be told were to look. When they were back from their 
		journey they would be aware of the signature energy and know when they 
		had found the spot. - Some were also found by accident by just being 
		very sensitive to the energy differences in the environment. </span></p>

		kind created harmony in the region. As far as shamans understood, the

		consciousness”, which would guarantee their future. The Majorville 
		location was picked because of the recognized energy there. This place 
		was also energetically connected to other power spots all over North 
		America. Celestial alignments at the sites were strictly for timing, to 
		guarantee mass group origination over large distances. In other words 
		celestial periods were a method of timing or determining a date for

		sorrow, anguish and loss of a beautiful culture that cannot be 
		retrieved. I was informed that there is guidance from this past that can

		<p class="style8"><span lang="EN-CA"><span class="style4">At St. Victor Petroglyphs, it's

		lighter” (a person that hunts at night with a light). One positive thing 
		about St. Victor's is that it does have some local guardians like Dave 
		Munro of St. Victor, Saskatchewan. He is aware of the importance of the 
		site and the energy vortex at the top of the hill. I'm not trying to 
		promote ceremonies at these sites. In fact that is the best way to 
		destroy the site and its energy connection to the past. What I'm saying 
		is if you want to learn and understand there are some powerful energies 
		that will help. All that is required on the most basic levels is to put 
		as much time in at these sites as you can. In time your vibration will 
		mesh with the sites, and the information-energy will come in very 
		easily. These people from the past were very powerful and knowledgeable. 
		They spent their lifetimes at these sites as shamans contacting 
		“nonordinary realities”.<font color="#FF3300"> Appling any “modern”
