		T</span><span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">here 
		are many ways to connect to the past. I have found one of the most 
		efficient methods is to sit in silence at a sacred site, in a meditative 
		state. <u>(Performing ceremony at the sites is an insult to the 
		builders, journeying or meditating to learn is honouring these 
		individuals)</u>. In this meditative state one can connect to the 
		knowledge embedded in the site simply by immersing oneself into the 
		energy, the longer the better (hours or days worth of exposure). <o:p></o:p>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		An alternative method is a meditation or journey at home with an 
		artifact from the past. Both give one the advantage and the opportunity 
		of being in the physical and yet connected to the moment of the 
		artifacts creation. Unfortunately connecting is not as easy as it sounds 
		for we need what are called “Bridges” or connectors that can link our 
		consciousness to the past event. It is well known that the more time one 
		is immersed in the sacred site energy, the easier it becomes to connect 
		with, as this itself is a “Bridge”. The purpose is to attune to the 
		energy, assimilating the vibration and creating a common “vibrational 
		ground” so that an exchange can take place. Once you are resonating to 
		this level of the energy, regardless of “flow direction”, the 
		information will start flowing in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		With a small difference the artifact method requires a different type of 
		bridge than the sites because we are not standing in the middle of the 
		energy, like at a site. Also the artifacts energy is usually much more 
		subtle as it was created by one individual as compared to the many that 
		are involved in large sites. This artifact method needs a stepping stone 
		or resonate tuning bridge that can act as an intermediate with the 
		artifact. This intermediate one is usually a familiar “Bridge or 
		Communicator” object that you have worked with prior. Shamans that use 
		tools will understand this type. With one in each hand and the 
		meditation set with desire, one only has to clear ones mind and allow 
		the information or experience to happen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		Connecting to the past by using “Bridges” (be it energetic or physical) 
		is necessary if true connection is to be made. Time is not what we 
		perceive for it has barriers that are necessary to allow individuality 
		of creation. Time is a very complex design of cycles that are possible 
		to connect with or bridge if one understands what time is and its 
		structure. Without understanding the structure you are guessing at 
		probable outcomes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		There is absolutely nothing in current scientific understandings that 
		comes close to understanding time, and that is why this work is so 
		valuable. One cannot do it alone but many can. It has to be done this 
		way, for this is the way of the mystic, the way of our original human 
		design, a design that is patterned in our DNA. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		In very general terms; gaps in time are due to frequency barriers that 
		exist in years, months, days, and even hours of our lives. They go 
		unnoticed by us as we have all produced a perception of a seamless 
		reality (starting from our early childhood training as humans). The 
		greatest energetic part of creation’s physical form will be its original 
		injection into a reality. From there, “time” appears to erode this 
		creational form away, as it is a composition of the elements and other 
		biological processes that have been orchestrated by consciousness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		</span>After the main injection or impetus of energy, the form only 
		needs a small amount of energy for maintenance and support in the 
		physical. The reason for this is that there are billions of smaller 
		consciousnesses that were solicited in the co-creation of this physical 
		form.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		seamlessness of time is a product of continuous energy supply from many 
		levels of our being, mainly nonphysical, but because the original 
		impetus to create has been fulfilled (at the end of the cycle), the 
		requirements will now change. The form finds itself in a state of 
		repetition (the same as time cycles, due to the Universal Structure’s 
		flow). But this is not a supportive role for spiritual evolution, for it 
		is the evolution of consciousness that is the only reason for existence. 
		(<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Remember, consciousness <u>is 
		not in the brain</u> as it is nonphysical or what we call spirit</b>) <o:p></o:p>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		The original form continues to cycle, in its original cycle of existence 
		but as said, consciousness evolves and the original form’s design gets 
		left behind. Conscious energy, (our awareness of it is not necessary) 
		upon recharging the physical creation in the new cycle will produce a 
		slightly different physical form or body image. The result is a body 
		that has a very small difference than that of the original. This is a 
		result of a shift in consciousness upon entering a new cycle. The slight 
		change in desired needs, in the new cycle will create a slight change in 
		the physical form and its expressions. This happens all the time in our 
		lives from the smallest to the largest cycles, until we fulfill our 
		desired expression here. This can be observed as the change, we 
		understand, as the aging process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		New cycles in the Earth and Universal structure will be under influences 
		of new energies and flows from ever higher levels of consciousness. 
		Physical Reality thus changes and evolves as does the consciousness that 
		created it. Bridging the past is not a matter of remembering. It is a 
		process of following the conscious energy back into the original desire 
		for its creation, and into that particular cycle/time, assimilating to 
		the frequency of the period or type of consciousness cycle that was part 
		of the artifact’s creation. This is the doorway into the artifact’s 
		world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<span class="style2" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		There are many types of consciousness and that includes humans present 
		or past. Each type of consciousness will follow the design of its Soul 
		Group configuration. For more on Soul Groups see “The Schematic of God” 
		book. In amongst this are veils or frequency bands that hold resident 
		frequencies together (time being one aspect). You cannot just jump in or 
		force your way in without prior preparation. For instance you cannot 
		travel back five thousand years without first adjusting your modern 
		vibration to earlier time frames and conscious matrixes. Typically our 
		modern consciousness can only connect back to a few generations. To go 
		further back in time you need tools and these are available to us. <o:p></o:p>
