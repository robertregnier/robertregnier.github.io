		In some ways the cycle has no end or beginning as time travels in both directions and 
		our senses can only detect forward flow as the backward flow cancels out 
		the forward one. The diagram below shows how time cycles are introduced 
		into a reality (diagram is a two-dimensional slice). The sphere 
		ratcheting down into a smaller 8 pack spheres show how a larger cycle of 
		time affects these smaller sphere cycles. In this basic diagram a patch 
		head (shown in red) is being influenced by two different sized time 
		cycles. These are shown flowing in opposite directions, as they are duel 
		energy flows themselves. Filtering the experience of which flow was 
		relevant to an observer would be a simple matter of which direction they 
		themselves are flowing. If the energy “half” of the time cycle is 
		flowing up into higher harmonics then these people would be following 
		this experiential evolution. If on the other hand the conscious desire 
		was to ground into the lower harmonics, then that would be the filter 
		system and one’s direction. The cycling aspect of larger cycle rotating 
		through the smaller sphere would appear to a person in the physical as 
		being slower or a larger time period. This is because their higher 
		vibrational rates in the smaller cycles, which are finer and thus a 
		quicker frequency. In our reality this makes the larger cycles appear to 
		take more time to transpire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		A few years ago when I was researching the L Gate the above diagram was 
		given to me. From top left to the end at the bottom right is a breakdown 
		of this very complex understanding. The “L” Gate allows overlapping 
		realities to be accessed, via a 90-degree ratchet. In the term “L” Gate 
		the “L” stands for a 90-degree turn. UFOs disappear from our perception 
		using this gateway as witnesses have seen in
		<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>the 90 degree turn, as the UFO 
		“blinks out” of their perception and reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

		We live in a reality that can be summed up as perception based and of 
		conscious construction. This construction is nothing more than a type of 
		camouflage that convinces out physical mind that everything is real. 
		Camouflage means, anything what our senses perceives is also a mask of 
		what is actually behind it. In other words the construction behind the 
		camouflage is not sensed, as we are blinded by our 5 physical senses.
		The UFO phenomenon is a classic example of this and bears the truth 
		behind the above statement. They are not what they appear, but are our 
		interpretation of their form.

		<span class="style3" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		Advanced science in other realities learnt 
		how to travel between planes of existence. Due to their reality laws 
		(vibration) they bring with them their own camouflage manifestations. 
		This cannot be separated on some levels as every physical or semi 
		physical reality will have its own camouflage individuality.<o:p> </o:p>
		As they leave their manifestation via the L Gate they bring with them 
		their camouflaged patterns. Certain kinds of science cannot operate 
		without it.

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span class="style3" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		When the inhabitants of a plane have learnt mental science 
		patterns, they then are to a great degree almost free from the more 
		restricted camouflage patterns. The UFOs appearances come from extremely 
		technologically advanced systems but they are still of this mental 
		science plane. Their appearance in our plane offers a conflict of sorts 
		as their system is not ours and this put their “craft” into a state 
		somewhere between the two planes. It is in conflict between realities 
		and that includes our perception, is also in a state of flux. <o:p></o:p>

		<span class="style3" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		All atoms and elements in our universe are the same but the 
		interpretation or perception (camouflage) of how they are experienced 
		can be quite different. A metal in our reality might not have the same 
		properties as a metal in others. So upon entering our system their 
		material construction tries to distort into our mental reality. 
		Generally their construction remains intact on their “side” but we 
		struggle to perceive what does not come from here and what cannot be 
		constructed with these “properties”. From our observations this lends to 
		the UFOs changing shapes from a disc, to a tube, or sphere. There are 
		not different UFOs but different struggles of perception. It gets even 
		more complicated when you bring into the formula different human 
		perspectives of the same event. Some see the UFO while others standing 
		beside them see nothing.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><span class="style3" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">&nbsp;

		The above diagram is one I was shown many times. In this simple diagram 
		I show only a few expanded ribbons of energy to demonstrate what I was 
		taught about life connections. Within Earth’s energetic structure (patch 
		head) each species has its own angular flow and its own time current 
		within this. As large and small cycles continue the supportive energy it 
		maintains a species in its reality. As the time cycles move off to more 
		canted angles this supportive energy wanes. The waning of earth 
		realities and time cycles results in a change of types of species. This is 
		referred to as evolution or extinction, depending on one’s view. Most do 
		not want to accept the idea that evolution of species can only happen if 
		others become extinct. The truth is this is the way all levels of spirit grow, 
		including humans. In the animal kingdom many different species will have 
		common sources that try on different forms to enhance their physical 
		experience. This is subject to the evolving vibrational levels of the 
		planet’s position in time, as each form must be current with this 
		vibrational level to maintain its existence.
