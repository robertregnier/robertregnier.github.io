		about the owl culture: There are many secret societies of shamans – the 
		Owl ones are a variant of the Earth&#39;s 3<sup>rd</sup> energy (90 degree), 
		the seers of the nation. More animals also represented here – snake, horse, 
		bear, deer, buffalo, etc. These are all Earth horizontal levels – shown 
		the Earth Horizons with many hundreds of horizons of varying degrees of 
		densities between - separate horizontal levels. These groups worked on 
		the physical level or the Middle World level. This group adopted the 
		conscious focus of Owls, as they were the seers. Other bird shaman 
		groups adopted different birds and their qualities, as seen in the birds 
		themselves. Flying aspect of birds was the dominate quality sought by 
		most of these groups, with some smaller shamanic groups adopting 
		specialized qualities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p>

		Note:&nbsp; Beads were first used and invented as a way to carry energy stones 
		from sacred areas and sites. The shamans started this portable method of 
		“medicine bag” and others saw its importance, without the 
		understandings. This method eventually became a power status symbol and 
		then a form of desired statement or adornment. Bead necklaces and 
		pendants were the results. The birth of jewellery.

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">Note:&nbsp; Ghost Dance started by shaman as far back as 
		4,000 years ago. It grew in understanding and acceptance by 3,000 years 
		ago and was ready for implication at 2,800 BP and again at the 2,000 BP 
		cycle. Each cycle saw the importance of it as the shamans where honing 
		into a future event and its importance to their culture. I saw this and 
		have no doubt of its authenticity. Dance was adapted in recent history 
		as a connection back to older cycles could be made. <u>Natives of today 
		would do well to use this dance as it has great importance in 
		connections to the most powerful ones of the past.</u> In these past 
		time cycles there were native councils that saw the future demise of 
		their culture. Councils were too small and this left little activation 
		on larger populations of North American natives = too little too late = 
		Ghost Dance was answer but 100 years too late! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		were used for journeys into the direction of the Dorajuadoik.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span>This is the pyramid opposite, and into direction of denser 
		nonphysical realities. Both ancient cultures (pyramid and stone sphere) 
		were here to balance each other out in reality. New Grange and Silbury 
		Hill are also spheres similar to pyramids in their height but are 
		composed of shells (layers of different earths) as symbolically and to 
		some extent workable layers representing and functionally creating

		fist with small stone spheres and then in time with groups on larger

		structure. They also arranged the spheres into more dynamic structures 
		to create different results. Eventually structures became more important 
		then results until the lessons and results were lost by the following 
		generations. This shamanic culture fell apart shortly afterwards. <o:p></o:p>

		As we begin to wrap up this existence called life we open doorways to 
		“home”. If one is truly open and aware of this process it can and will 
		be a perfect goodbye to this reality. The cycle is complete, as the same 
		connections can be felt when the cycle first started (birth). The 
		ancient cultures knew this and because of this they respected their 
		elders for their insights. Today very few elders are connected to their 
		essence self, as most are hypnotized into modern cultural belief 
		systems.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not die 
		without notice nor do we do it in a single act. Dyeing takes years of 
		preparation, as it took years (in our terms) for spirit to create our

		Note:&nbsp; Recently I was doing some RVing (Remote Viewing) back to the 
		last North America Ice Age era. I didn’t intend to go back to 10,000 
		years as I was initially interested in the Ice Age at 14,000 BP. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: silver; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
		I went 
		out of body and found myself a couple hundred feet above the southern 
		tip of Vancouver Island looking west down the Juan De Fuca Strait. I was 
		not surprised to see a narrower channel (all in color) but I was 
		surprised that I ended up at 10,000 BP and not the intended 14,000 BP 
		that I had asked for. Realizing this mistake I tried again but this time 
		I did it in increments by asking for 12,000, 13,000, and 14,000 BP. 
		Unfortunately as I went back the light got so dime that near 14,000 BP 
		it was too dark to see anything. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: silver; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
		Later that night I did some channelling to find out what had happened to 
		the 14,000 scene. I was told that starting at 10,000 years ago would 
		take me to the beginning of this present orb cycle. This would be the 
		major 10,000 year cycle that is currently the occupied creation of this 
		reality. If I go further back into this time cycle I start to enter into 
		a denser vibratory level. In other words I start to leave this major Orb 
		Cycle and enter into the “last” or an older and prior 10,000 reality cycle. The 
		vibration that I started with was not conducive to this older cycle and 
		its vibration. This is why the density of the older cycle started a 
		breakdown of observable reality and thus it got darker. The only way 
		around this is to start in the prior 10,000 year cycle and then explore 
		further back to 14,000 BP. (<o:p>I should have known better!)</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: silver; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
		I asked about the Earth orb shift that takes place in this 10,000 year 
		period of creation. It was explained to me that the people in balance 
		and or of higher vibrations will shift into the new reality, as they are 
		more suited to it. All physical realities are a conscious perception of 
		creation in a physical construct. You are in a reality by choice and 
		vibration of like kind. The shift is seamless to the ones that can do it 
		and not possible for the others who stay in the old more comfortable 
		reality cycle. I also asked to see what actually happens to the surface 
		of the earth during this shift….it was blocked from me.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: silver; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
		Second journey was with artifacts of the 14,000 range. First vision was 
		a white glowing round cornered square suspended in a black background. 
		This shifted into an energy tunnel as seen in diagram below. From there 
		the scene shifted into a brown stone tunnel that I was heading down. It 
		curved to the right and then I came upon a veiled wall of grey energy. 
		This was the edge of the physical creational orb wall of the older orb 
		cycle. This second journey was done with RVing only, it was explained 
		to me the difference in RVing and OBEs are that the name implies. 
		Out of Body refers to and insinuates a conscious awareness of the 
		physical body connection, and the reality construct that was left 
		behind. The RVing is done with conscious awareness only and there is no 
		limit to this as there is no level or reality limit to the soul 
		consciousness. <o:p></o:p></p>

		tablet is form the Mexican side of this family mix. (Solutrean/Mexican 
		Original). The trees (I outlined them with a dark background) are from 
		their “totem”. Many shamanic ceremonies were carried out at the Gault 
		site to ground this alliance of families – Original Mexicans and 
		Solutrean mix side. The Gault Site is a time keeper work site and part 
		of the birth place for shamanic Clovis culture. Cross thatching is 
		Solutrean #1 side. Plant aspect of this group – agrarian Solutrean 2 
		attraction, grid ones are the hunter side Solutrean #1. The stone image 
		is a blend of nature’s sources. Both tablets below are shown in their proper 
		positions – it is an opposite focus of the grid ones. Grid shamans focused 
		on structure while the others focused on flow of energy into structure. 
		The combination of this work was a level of ascension for them in their time and 
		vibration. Limestone tables are a Solutrean tradition, as documented in 
		European Solutrean sites. <o:p></o:p>
