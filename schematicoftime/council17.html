		enhance one’s life either in knowledge or strength. A Medicine Bag works 
		on the same principle as the other two but with a more present time 
		specialized usage. It typically is a collection of objects (or pieces) 
		from various origins that can enhance a shaman’s abilities, all being 
		relevant to individual desires. </span>&nbsp;(<a href="council11.html">See

		All religions use them as recognized objects of worship from the iconic 
		objects to the actual temple design itself. Shrines go back in history 
		into the tens of thousand years and have their roots in shamanic 
		understandings. Imprinted into the human psyche for thousands of years 
		they are still being expressed, but many aspects and understandings of 
		the old shamanic traditions are lost. In modern times and in every 
		corner of the world shrines have been adapted by current religions. The 
		simple kneeling and prayer position in front of a religious shrine shows 
		the angular dialling of energies that a person is doing. Unfortunately 
		many are not aware of the process or the abilities around this, as the 
		information has been lost for eons. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		matrix or structure of the physical and nonphysical universe. The 
		structural design of the universe, even on the most basic levels, is 
		still unknown to science and yet most ancient sites were designed with 
		this in mind. <u>They were not built to align with astronomical objects.</u> 
		There is no great advantage to this, although astrological positions 
		were used to find the angles that were needed. The universal structural 
		knowledge is too large for this website due to all the related subjects 
		that would need to be addressed. Without this complete understanding, 
		what I can do for now is to draw upon some basics of the energy flow 
		that shrines and sites perform for the individual. I cannot overly 
		express the value of this work for any shaman and the abilities that it 
		gives one when done right. 90% of the information on this website was 
		gleamed using the shrine-mudra method, along with Remote Viewing and 
		OBEs..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		to larger spheres of energy that support it. This includes the larger 
		sphere of our Earth Reality and its ability to support our existence in 
		the physical. These larger spheres are responsible for the energy that 
		maintains our home sphere, our community, and so on until the universal 
		energy sphere is reached. We are connected to all of them by virtue of 
		being in the physical universe. There is no exception to this rule, as 
		it starts at the atomic level and ends up in size with the largest 
		celestial objects and universes. Everything that exists has an energy 
		sphere and it is connected to the matrix of everything else in the 
		universe, physical or nonphysical.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		dowse it carefully asking the right questions you will find straight 
		lines of energy connecting all parts of your interior living space. You 
		will also see hubs of energy in this space that are connected with each 
		other. These hubs are called vortex portholes and are very important in 
		this type of work. There are typically lower and higher energy flows 
		that move in opposite directions from the core of this localized energetic sphere. In all vortex flows there will be a balance of energy, 
		including the larger universal portholes called Black Holes. These too

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">On the basic nonphysical level of creating (just prior 
		to the physical) the sphere is a structure of balanced energy flows. 
		These flows are the axis portholes that create and form the sphere 
		itself. They are axis energy currents that run through the center with 
		upper movement known as 0 degrees, and downward flow as 180 degrees. The 
		other main currents are at 90 degrees from the vertical axis currents. These 
		four 90 degree flows are known as the event horizon portholes or axis and are 
		responsible for creating and maintaining the physical reality. This 
		includes the elements at an atomic level. All the angles in between 
		these main coordinate flows are combinations of the energies, with 
		specific angle strengths leaning towards the closest flavour of an axis. To 
		understand how a shrine works you must see it in a 360 degree fashion 
		and in a three dimensional structure containing every possible angle. <o:p></o:p>

		the easiest way to see the supporting angles of energy that flow in and

		others have some creational design here too. In your room of choice, 
		position yourself on “your” chair. As you sit there, look around and see 
		the placement of every object in the room including the TV, bookshelf, 
		pictures on the walls, and so on. Using a compass will tell you were 
		north and south are. Using this axis as a reference point, you will be 
		able to determine the angles of all the objects in the room. Look at 
		these objects and see what they represent to you. Is it on a physical 
		support, emotional level, spiritual, or is it intellectual. This will give you a 
		basic understanding of what angles of energy flow are supporting 
		your creation in this reality. These angles of energy are supporting 
		your life and have been chosen by you on couscous and unconscious levels. There are 
		no mistakes in this, as life is your creation and if the purpose of the 
		object is detrimental or beneficial you will feel it. If the room 
		doesn’t allow an efficient flow (straight to source energy) then they 
		will be bent or have a longer path of energy flow. This can translate 
		into slower time and strength aspects of supporting energy, inefficiency 
		in connecting. The connection will always be there it is just a matter 
		of efficiency of flow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		our nonphysical consciousness. You may think that you have purchased an

		for this design for years. It is all done from the nonphysical aspects 
		of our higher selves. Our home’s position in the community and placement 
		in the environment is by choice. This choice is fundamentally for the 
		greater purpose of our present and future needs. Likewise the 
		furnishings in our home are a product of our subconscious. This part is 
		easier to see as it is closer to the physical conscious part of us. The 
		arrangement of everything in our life is a refection of all our aspects 
		from the physical to the highest nonphysical levels. Shrines are blue

		These sites have lost part of the energy flow due to Earth Procession. 
		As Earth’s tilt shifts so does the connective efficiency or positioning 
		of the elements in the site&#39;s construction. This is why some pyramids were 
		rebuilt every 50 some years and why some sites are abandoned all 
		together. It was recognized that building a new site was easier than

		the right is an actual Mayan shrine found in a recent excavation. The 
		objects as well as their positions were important for this work and 
		relevant to the energies or connections that were being utilized. In my 
		shrine on the left, I was researching some of the material in this 
		website. The Mayan leader that created or worked with his shrine on the 
		right had a different focus. As you can see there are statues of 
		different people, of different position in their society. This shrine 
		would not do well for the work I was doing any more than my shrine would 
		accomplish his desires. The pattern changes with the week, month, and so 
		on but mostly on the subject matter that one desires. The journeys and 
		shrines I used for researching subatomic structures would require a

		to). If you are drawn to more than one object, pick them both up and

		mudras (through guidance) during the night’s session to be an extremely 
		valuable part of this method. Mudras help to “shift gears” for the next 
		lesson or towards your next question. They may all appear to be similar 
		but the energies, vibrations, and angles are always different. With the

		circle around the axis at 
		170 degrees). The 45 degree angles (8 of them) are the electromagnetic 
		angles of element creation. Anything to the right of the axis is future

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">The mudra is the key to activating a shrine. Mudras are 
		similar to shrines in that they connect to the energy lines of creation. 
		They unfold in every movement life takes as there is not a body stance 
		or action that is not a mudra. Each movement of your body is a result of 
		a need or desire to create. This is accomplished thought consciousness, 
		which <u>does not reside in the physical body</u>. Consciousness is 
		nonphysical and uses the physical brain to articulate its desires 
		through neurological expressions. This requires the appropriate energy 
		angles that are alignments from nonphysical structure to physical 
		structure. This flow is constant, for when it ceases so does your 
		physical creation. The simple moment of a finger requires this 
		connection to the physical brain and other involved body parts. It is 
		through this process that the mudra becomes a switchboard to the 
		universal network. Our bodies shape and positions are all part of the 
		supportive energies that maintain our existence in a reality. As in the 
		shrine upward angles are flows of higher or finer vibrational energy and 
		lower angles are connections to denser world vibrations. All angles are 
		equal in quality and importance for if one flow is dominating over the 
		others, the imbalance is seen in the biology and mind of the person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

		Also notice the fingers and stature position, standing, sitting, leg 
		position and so on. These are all important when doing a mudra. Every 
		part of our body has specific connecting abilities and the combinations 
		of all the parts with desire create the mosaic of intent, called a 
		Mudra. In the left picture the crown charka pointing to 90 degree or event

mso-ansi-language:EN">All flat or two dimensional shrines are connections into 
		the 360 degree space of reality. Another method of enhancing this work 
		can be done with 3 dimensional shrines. The ceramic bowl is a classic 
		one from the past and many shamans today still use this method. In this 
		method there is a slight difference in direction of focus. In a two 
		dimensional shrine the focus is on the axis and center, the energy 
		radiates out. In the bowl shrine the focus is into the center of the 360 
		degree shrine, with the bowl’s perimeter acting as the boundary of a 
		sphere’s focus. There are two methods that I have been taught and one is 
		to focus at the “opening plane” of the bowl. This would be at the full 
		fluid level, if a liquid was there (shown as a grey line in the 
		picture). This area of focus appears related to enhancing psychic 
		abilities in the physical (Nostradamus Effect). The other method is to 
		find the midway point at the center of the bowl and focus there (green 
		lines in left picture). This focus area is one of inner work or 
		journeys, going deep inside, of whatever your intents are for the 
		session. This second method is great for inner healing work. Extra 
		objects can also be placed into the bowl to increase energy specifics, 
		as seen in the shamanic Trypillian bowl above (can you imagine an 
		archeologist trying to understand this find). Remember placement of 
		objects inside the bowl will have different effects (use guidance).

		You have your artifacts and your shrine is complete but the effectiveness 
		of this type of work is in understanding the mudra connections. The 
		universal structure that surrounds your present self has a guideline to 
		how effective or efficient the mudra is. To use mudras for effective 
		connections to the appropriate sources one needs to know the angles and 
		spatial quadrants associated with them. In the above diagrams I have 
		shown what I have been taught. Standing or sitting in front of your 
		shrine’s axis, focus your attention or travel (OBEs) towards the 
		quadrant of choice. The angles of your “takeoff” are the key for 
		effective results. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		The planes shown in the diagram are called Event Horizon Planes. In 
		this work the horizontal planes and vertical planes are treated as 
		layered events of creation. They are both called event horizons but they 
		vary in angular degrees and thus energetic abilities or flavours. The 
		planes are also layered to make up a complete cube structure. This is on the 
		very basic level of the universal structure.

		When using these planes in a mudra have your palms open and facing the 
		direction of connection. Placing ones arms straight out to the side will 
		show the <u>facing</u> open palms connecting to a horizontal plane. See 
		the planes as slices (slices of reality) as this is what my teachers 
		call them. Rotating the palms will connect to a different layer or 
		slice. Experiment with this in a meditative state observing the energy 
		differences in your palms. The knowledge of the planes or slices is a 
		very important aspect of this type of work.</span></p>
