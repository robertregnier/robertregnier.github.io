When I have been there I tried not to take photos with people in them. The reason being, I just wanted the photo to show the site in its purity, without distractions of people standing in the middle of it, like some kind of tourist photo. I do have photos of the Tie Creek Site with people looking around the site but other than serving as memories for me there was little value for the public or my research. To my surprise what I have now found out was it depends on where they are standing in the site and in what direction the camera is facing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The photos are from a 17-year period with at least 5 different cameras. They range from a 35mm Canon to the new i-phone. Facing towards the “vortex bubble” (a sphere effect) the leaning trees outline the sphere’s edges but when facing away from this spot all the trees are straight and not leaning in any direction. I have placed links around the diagram showing this, unfortunately I realized this after I was home and had to pick through my photos with some just catching this effect to the side of the picture. Tie Creek is half way across Canada for me now so I don’t know when I will be back to get more aligned photos. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The sphere occupying the vortex location is a result of two opposite flowing spirals of energy. Because of this they also have “onion layers” or “shells” so more research is needed to define the complete effect, as observed in this reality. It was explained to me that what was being observed was a reality shift created by the observation of the sphere’s influence into our reality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

There are thin reality compositions at these power spots and because of this other realities can and do influence or merge with our reality and its focused event horizon. All event horizons are composed of shells or different layers of frequency, along with its sphere and spiral, so an observable horizon may be above or below the surface of the site. This is why if one projects the observable shape of the sphere onto what can be seen (in this case with the trees) its &quot;middle&quot; or event horizon may be out of reach for our reality. </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">(For more on the structure see - </span><span class="style114"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1"><a class="style109" href="researching3.htm">The Schematic of Time and Ancient Sites</a></span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA"><o:p>)</o:p></span></p>

Recognition of these edges is simply a matter of connecting to them by mimicking their shape. So the shape establishes the connection. Square, circular, triangular, etc. are shapes that resonate with the human form.

These are main coordinate points, pure mathematically, sources of fantastic energy, with vast numbers of subordinate coordinate points. There are four absolute coordinate points that intersect all realities. These coordinate points also act as channels through which energy flows and as warps or invisible paths from one reality to another. They also act as transformers and provide much of the generating energy that makes creation continuous in our terms. <br />
		<br />
		I do recommend that before you do any work in these areas that you first know yourself. This may seem on the surface to be a simple statement but it is not that simple. The majority of people on this planet do not understand real reality or how we create everything on a minute by minute basis. They are unaware of the incredible power that they have and how all of it is contained and controlled by one&#39;s beliefs and consciousness. This power that we have and use every minute of every day is accelerated in creative swiftness at these coordinate points or vortex areas. This is why; not understanding your beliefs and how they serve you can place you into uncomfortable situations when working in such intense spots. <br />
		<br />
		All the emotions come into play at these sacred power sites including manifesting our fears, spiritual uncertainty and our self-judgment or self-criticism. Also, if you are open and ready to receive but have not done your &quot;homework&quot;, this amount of energy and the acceleration can also be uncomfortable. Some people have experienced headaches caused by this acceleration. The most famous person was Thomas Jefferson, president of the Unite States. He built his estate right in the middle of a large octagon shaped Hopewell mound. He complained of constant headaches and in 1819 wrote &quot;I slumber without fear, and review in my dreams the vision of antiquity&quot;.<br />

		Our surrounding space is also filled with subordinate points and is important in allowing us to transform thoughts and emotions into physical matter. When a thought or emotion attains a certain intensity it automatically attracts the power of one of these subordinate points and is therefore highly charged and in one way magnified, though not in size.<br />
		<br />
		These points impinge upon what you call time as well as space. Therefore, there are certain points in time and space that are more conducive than others. Practically speaking, this means that buildings will last longer in your context, that ideas wedded to form will be relatively eternal. The pyramids, for example, are a classic example of longevity.<br />
		<br />
		These coordinate points (absolute, main, or subordinate) represent accumulations or traces of pure energy. If you are thinking in terms of size (minute to an extreme) they are smaller than any particle that our scientists know. However, they are composed of pure energy and this energy must be activated. It is dormant until then and it cannot be activated physically. This is important to understand. Performing ceremonies at these sites has little to no effect on what is trying to be accomplished. The ceremony only serves to enforce the illusion that directly will affect the emotional impute, thus allowing a connection to the energy. <br />
		<br />
		There is an ever-so-minute alternation of the forces in the neighborhood of all of these points. Even the subordinate one and all the so-called physical laws to some extent or another will be found to have a wavering effect in these neighborhoods. The subordinate points also serve in a way as supports, as structural intensifications widen the unseen fabric of energy that forms all realities and manifestations. While there are traces or accumulations of pure energy there is a great difference between the amount of energy available in the various subordinate points and between the main and the absolute points.<br />
		<br />
		Therefore, these are points of concentrated energy. The subordinate points are far more common and practically speaking, affect your daily concerns. There are better places than others to build houses or structures - points where health and vitality are strengthened, where other things being equal, plants will grow and flourish and where all beneficial conditions seem to meet. In a given room providing that both areas contain the necessary requirement of light, plants will grow more effectively in a particular area than in other areas, providing that both areas contain such necessary requirements as light.<o:p></o:p></p>

I do not support them per se nor do I reject them but appearances from some websites suggest a bit of ad-libbing. I would prefer that the observations be made without the buildings. It is too easy to create slanted buildings into a slope that give the illusion of someone is leaning to the side. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

These usually come from people living on remote ranches, or outsiders who have gotten lost in the desert. People have seen fireballs in the sky and, at times, flames rolling down the sides of mountains like massive, ignited tumbleweeds.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
