		<span class="style2">In the shamanic world there are two basic “visible” 
		forms that guides take, in the lower world it is usually animal or 
		nondescript hominid form and in the upper it is human in shape or again 
		nondescript ranging to nonphysical presence or just light. None of these 
		forms, regardless of their source are of any importance for most if not 
		all are an interpretation of our conscious level trying to make sense of 
		it all. This understanding will also show us if we have prior life 
		contacts or memories from other physical and nonphysical worlds. On the 
		other hand if you are a devout religious person the form could manifest 
		for your comfort only as Mohammed, Jesus, Krishna, and so on.</span><span class="style2" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		</span><span class="style2">Fear based journeys of course will create 
		perceived devils and monsters which again, are very real manifestation 
		of our inner conscious imbalances (<u>we create what we fear on all 
		levels</u>). In the lower world each guide can be subdivided into 
		familiar forms like bears, wolves, birds, snakes, and so on as these 
		individual Earth based forms are stereotypical forms that have 
		vibrational associations to their nonphysical levels. None of these 
		forms are as they present themselves for they are all nonphysical 
		energy. But they can replicate the familiarity of vibration for our 
		comfort. </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">They are also referred to as Totem Animals or Animal Guides. </span><span style="mso-ascii-font-family:

		Another interesting effect (that can be explained in great detail) is 
		that if you go too far in one direction, say in the lower world you will 
		inevitably pop up into the upper world. This is because the universe is 
		a sphere and all of creation, on all levels, are supported by their 
		individual sphere. Most energy workers are familiar with upper world light and 
		angels but there is a counterpart that is just as powerful an expression 
		in balance. This one can be found in the most complete level of balance 
		deep in the lower world. I would like to introduce this one as it is a

		“All That Is” has created an energy balance that we recognize in human

		“All That Is” flows in opposites of itself. Both are in complete balance

		In the lower vibrational field (Lower World) an entity exists that is 
		the last level that can be observed by the human consciousness. This 
		supreme entity represents and has the qualities of the original God 
		aspect. It exists in pure love and is a mirror of the angelic world 
		(Upper World). Both upper and lower aspects are pure love; both are 
		dualities of the other, dualities of All That Is - God flow. The 
		silica/lower vibrational aspect (see “Schematic of God” for explanation 
		of Silica Forms) represented the opposite state, but in a total 
		unconditional acceptance format. This level of love is defined as total 
		neutrality and acceptance in mass. This means unconditional love for all 
		in a mass level (mass is defined as all sentient beings). This level 
		sees everything as one for individuality would be its dual opposite 
		understanding. <o:p></o:p></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #C0C0C0;">
		This level of love can be observed in physical animals for there is a 
		total acceptance that can be felt. There is no judgment only recognition 
		of your entry into their environment. This Dorajuadoik entity is one of 
		the most evolved aspects of silica flow direction and is equal in 
		spiritual evolution to any angelic form. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #C0C0C0;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #C0C0C0;">
		Although love in the angelic world is also universal in acceptance, the 
		focus of teaching is towards individuality and acceptance of this state 
		in balance with oneself as the direction. In the Dorajuadoik 
		consciousness, love is about species or forms of creation and their 
		existence in the physical realities. In the human love model (currently 
		seen in our culture as a struggle) loving ourselves becomes the 
		direction to loving all else that exists on any level. On the other side 
		of the coin it is acceptance and love of all life, as seen in the 
		struggle through the acceptance of giving one’s life to benefit the 
		others existence (food chain). This level recognizes that life is 
		precious but it has the understanding that individuals cycle back into 
		ever evolving life forms. Growth comes from outside as in the higher 
		vibratory levels see growth coming from within. As we focus inward we 
		create our outside reality. As they focus outward they create the inward 
		reality for themselves, as expressed in numbers not individuals. They 
		focus outward to create inward as ever evolving deeper levels of the 
		masses, thus they are the spiritual animals, the vibrational level of 
		each species. The first and oldest of these levels, the essence and the 
		beginning of Earth life is Dorajuadoik. <o:p></o:p></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%">
		<span class="style2">What I’m saying is that each of these dualities or 
		opposites does have common virtues of the same value, but they are 
		mirrors of each other due to their flow direction. Neither is better 
		than the other as both directions are directional flows of Source Power 
		- God or “All That Is”. </span>
