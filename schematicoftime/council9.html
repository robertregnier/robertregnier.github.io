		today’s terms it all depends on your cultural background; the definition 
		ranges from a witch doctor to an amazing mystical healer. Some would 
		simply define them as a “primitive thinking individual”. If you lived in 
		a Stone Age culture you would have a different understanding based on 
		your needs and beliefs of the time period. The Western or European mind 
		set has had problems understanding the world of shamanism for the last 
		few hundred years. With the onset of controlled religious fervour 
		demanding more regulation over the masses, shamanism became the enemy as 
		it was the opposite of mind control. It was not a matter of religions 
		seeing shamanism as evil, although this was the label, it was more the 
		idea that a free willed person was a dangerous one. Religions by their 
		very nature require control and this intolerance for free spiritual will 
		was not going to propagate. This duality in ideology led to the demise 
		and eradication of the European shaman, their spiritual sites and 
		practices.</span><span class="style2" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		The sacred sites, one of the sources that linked the shaman community 
		together now became energetic hot spots in which a church could be 
		situated (to the energetic advantage of the church itself). If there was 
		little populace to support a church, then the site was destroyed. Today, 
		the impression of a shaman in western culture depends upon your 
		education, be it academic or otherwise. It ranges from old world 
		understandings to New Age hybrid beliefs, but the one thing that can be 
		said is that shamanism is the oldest spiritual practice known to 
		humanity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		can be likened to a “reality bubble” that surrounds our body in an 
		energetic orb structure. This orb can range in size from a few feet in 
		diameter, with the focus mainly being straight ahead; to a large multi 
		focused “bubble” that has no boundaries. Everyone has their own range of 
		awareness, most of which is dependent on our current spiritual 
		evolutionary level, be it physical or not. Awareness is directly 
		proportional to the vibrational level of an individual, regardless of 
		physical age, education, or intelligence. There are many individuals in 
		children’s bodies that are many times more aware than the senior 
		citizens in their community. <u>Awareness is the vibrational expression 
		in the physical reality</u> and it is the key to everything in all 
		realities. It is also the most important aptitude for shamanic work. 
		Awareness is not an ability that is generally learned in one lifetime, 
		but rather hundreds of lifetimes. Therefore the most dynamic are a 
		product of many lifetimes as a shaman. A good example of this lifetime 
		learning ability (non shamanic) is the famous General George S. Patton 
		who was fully aware of being a soldier in many prior lifetimes. His 
		success on the battlefield can be directly attributed to this past 
		lifetime knowledge. In fact his ability to remember the past lifetimes 
		actually hindered some of his decisions in some modern battles. This 
		classic example is one of the reasons why most have total amnesia when 
		it comes to remembering past lives.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		<span class="style2">Experience is the generator behind awareness and 
		the catalyst called intelligence can be the driving force that defines 
		what interest is being perceived. The more aware you are the more likely 
		that you will be monitoring everything in your world and/or just outside 
		of it, simultaneously. This level is an expansion beyond the personal 
		“reality bubble”. The key to being a shaman, on any level, is awareness. 
		This awareness operates in the physical and non physical, within certain 
		extents all the time. This is one of the differences between a spiritual 
		focus and the shamanic focus. Most spiritual workers are aware of the 
		nonphysical levels when focused there, but few can focus in present 
		reality and nonphysical reality at the same time. The shamanic ability 
		to do this comes from working in all three reality levels or “Worlds”, 
		with the desire to bring them together into the physical reality. 
		Workings in the lower vibrational realities are as fruitful as higher 
		ones, but it is only when integrated into the physical that benefits are 
		experienced. The shamanic level of awareness is the ability to sense on 
		all levels including what has already happened, where energy is flowing, 
		and into what time frame, past, present, or future it pertains to.</span><span class="style2" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

		<span class="style2">In my ancestral land of Eurasia they have different 
		categories of shamans. The first level is a
		<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Healer Shaman </b>(lower, more 
		physical). The second degree is called the
		<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">White Shaman</b> and the higher 
		vibrational level is called the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
		Black Shaman</b>. The unrecognized degree that follows the Black Shaman 
		is the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Indigo</b> “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Time</b></span>”<span class="style2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> 
		Shaman</b>. The color is actually closer to black with the indigo color 
		coming from a vibrational level of supplied energy that supports the 
		form. This indigo category works with and is a connector to the <u>
		highest</u> and the <u>lowest vibrations</u> at the same time bridging 
		them both together as one source. The mandate for this level is to 
		achieve complete power in balance with “Source Power” or “All That Is” 
		(God), which includes “All That Was” or both opposite flows of creation. 
		This indigo level is the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Time 
		Keeper</b> level where the dimensions and the “time” that separates them 
		are brought together to balance creational flow.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span class="style2">There are many different “Time Keepers” and these 
		are not meant to be compared. Hunbatz Men who is a Mayan shaman from the 
		Yucatan is one of the Time Keepers and also one of my teachers from a 
		few years ago. He is referred to as a “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Day 
		Keeper</b>” as he is a keeper of the ancient Mayan days and ways, the 
		source of this knowledge. It was his duty from birth as he was singled 
		out of a family of 12 children for this job. Coming from a Catholic 
		family he was not allowed to enter this segment of his culture, the 
		reason being to maintain purity in his Mayan mission. </span>
		<span class="style2" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="style2">All 
		shamans are individuals and all recognize strength in numbers regardless 
		of the focus they’re in. Each recognizes the other’s importance in the 
		whole as no shaman is higher in rank than the other. This would be the 
		opposite of what creates a shaman in the first place. The individuality 
		of each shaman is his or her focus and strength in the process as they 
		are all building towards the same balanced reality. </span>

		are different workers and different interests of pursuit. In the group

		Keeper</b>”. This title is given as a matter of prospective, of this 
		moment in time. I work with the past from this moment thus I’m in this 
		time period and the keeper of this period’s knowledge base. This title 
		means nothing other than I’m a worker from this station of reality and 
		focus. It also refers to the ability to reach back into time, connecting 
		with other like Time Shamans to solve personal and cultural imbalances. 
		Their quest could be different from mine (and most likely is) for my 
		view would be from this cultural aspect and time period. We would all 
		have very different needs and understandings but this is not a handicap 
		for most of the work is on energetic levels (an ability that is 
		conducive to the Translator artifacts).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

		Whiteshell Provincial Park of Manitoba, Canada (</span><span class="style4"><a href="../schematicgod/bannock.html">see 
		Bannock Point page</a></span><span class="style2">). This first contact was

		worker and as all typical shamans are, full of hope. I have through my 
		work found some of the answers to his question, but will only share 
		these with the present culture if there is interest. I’m not presently 
		from that native community but recall many lives as a shaman in 
		different North American native cultures. That past position allows me 
		to retrieve information, but culturally today, not to teach it without

		During the first contact with the Bannock Point shaman he introduced 
		himself as “Krishto”. This name was unrecognizable to me until just this 
		year after reading the book “The People” by Donald Ward. In the book he 
		talks about the Cree and their name origin;
		<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">“The tribal name of the Cree 
		evolved through various incarnations from a term that may have had 
		little relevance for them in the first place. One version is that an 
		Ojibwa word for a group of Indians who lived near James Bay was recorded 
		by the French as Kristineaux. This was later abbreviated to Cree and 
		applied to the whole nation. The anthropologist Diamond Jenness stated 
		simply that Kristineaux was the French form of a name, unknown meaning 
		that a portion of the tribe applied to itself.” </i>I understand now

		Remember we can only work so far in one direction before we start to see 
		the effects in the physical, so balance is needed and this is 
		accomplished by working in the opposite direction. If or when we feel 
		life is becoming hard, a struggle, this is an indicator that we need to 
		start working in the opposite direction. This work process is an 
		evolution and results in a teeter-totter effect as we connect to ever 
		increasing levels of deeper vibration (be it higher or lower). As we 
		flow deeper into any direction, we reach a point where the physical 
		reality we are experiencing is becoming disturbing or dysfunctional. 
		Stop there and work in the opposite until another unbalanced state is 
		observed. The teeter-totter is the “ladder” or stairway to deeper levels 
		regardless of direction. We also cannot jump through layers or levels 
		without first understanding them and integrating them into our being. 
		For those that have tried, they have found difficulty in relating to the 
		earth reality and its cultural needs. This need to balance the evolution 
		into spiritual realms is important for it not only can affect us but

		there are three levels of reality, called worlds (actually each has many 
		levels inside them, including the physical world, but that is for 
		another day). From the basic to the most advanced shamans they see three 
		levels and as you can imagine it is a generalization to keep things 
		simple. The lower level is the essence source power for the physical 
		which occupies the middle world level (the experience level we call 
		reality) while the upper is the source of modern human consciousness 
		including less dense semi physical levels that are grouped into and 
		include the sky, stars, and our sun. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">All three levels are connected by an axis or Axis Mundi 
		usually represented symbolically as the tree with its roots in the lower 
		world for physical support and the branches in the upper world reaching 
		to the ethers. The Tree of Life is known symbolically too many cultures 
		including the Mayan with their Wakah-Chan tree and the Jewish as the 
		Kabala. Different cultures also used different symbols for the tree; 
		ladders, zigzag lines, tent poles, cosmic mountains, bridges, smoke 
		columns, rainbows, rivers, and so on but all are referring to the 
		connective tube of energy at the center of the three levels. The truth 
		is they are all right for there is a central energy axis that is also 
		the core of our universe. Modern science understands it as
		<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Universal Anisotropy</b>, which 
		has an angle of 19.5 degrees. This angle is somewhat incorporated into 
		many ancient sites that worked in those energies but due to our present 
		Earth progression it has shifted and has not been recognized yet.
