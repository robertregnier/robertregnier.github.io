		The creation of our universe (on all levels of existence) was a result 
		of an injection of this powerful level of consciousness into itself. The 
		original thought form created expansiveness within itself, we call it 
		the universe. A universe with no limitations of expression for the 
		source level is incapable of limits. Defining this new universe is a 
		matter of defining different levels of the source consciousness. In 
		other words as the universe creates upon itself many different levels of 
		source energy are expressed. These “expressions” are measured in 
		vibratory levels. Through this injection all forms of consciousness are 
		created and recreated as expressions of the original thought. Each level 
		of consciousness thus inhabits its own level of awareness (or vibratory 
		state). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span class="style6">From the primal thought that created our universe to the many trillions 
		of thought forms that create all the realms, physical or not, there is 
		only one source of power. That source power of creation is 
		consciousness. Without consciousness physical and the nonphysical forms 
		would not exist. Thought, a creation of consciousness creates movement 
		in this static background. This can be described as imbalance, as it 
		forces a balanced static background of universal energy into movement. 
		This movement can be plotted as it has to adhere to the structure of the 
		universal design. This is the most important thing to understand and 
		remember, consciousness creates all that exists, on all levels, without 
		exception.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="style6">&nbsp; </span>
		<span class="style6">(By the way, our 
		consciousness does not reside in the brain as this organ is only a 
		translator for our physical reality.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

		Primal consciousness (God or “All That Is”) injected the primal desire

		“The Schematic of God”</span><span class="style5" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">). 
		Primal thought or consciousness thus is the impetus and driving force 
		behind the creation of the universe. This force graduates down into 
		individual levels from source point outward. Each level will create its 
		own specific region of unique individuality. The uniqueness is kept 
		separate by resonate difference in frequency, due to structural levels 
		of common ground. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		We will never see or understand all the levels but we can understand 
		some of the levels that are closer to the physical and in time we will 
		be able to detect many of these levels with instrumentation. In fact 
		some of this detection has happened now but without the understand of 
		what is being detected there is little proper interpretation.

		<span class="style6">In our understanding of consciousness as the highest vibratory state in 
		the universe we would have to start at the primal level of creation. 
		This level can be referred to as a God level and its seed vibratory 
		level, in our perception, could be called the Harmonic/Light Spectrum. 
		Both harmonics and light are different flows but because of origin they 
		are one. All energy regardless of its level will have a counter part 
		that acts as a balancing agent. It has to have movement in order to 
		exist in the physical. Without movement time and space would have no 
		measurement and thus would not exist at all. The Maya called God (Hunab 
		K’u) “movement and measure”, they understood this basic concept.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="style6">&nbsp;

		The light and harmonics I talk about are not what we would recognize in 
		the physical. Their vibrational level is far beyond the spectrum of the 
		physical reality and our comprehension. Yet they do permeate all levels 
		including our physical and do give us a recognizable part of this 
		spectrum in visible light and sound. The higher vibratory levels are not 
		detectable by physical senses or apparatus but can be found through 
		“mind avenues”. As described before there are two primal directional 
		flows. Each flow extends outward to complete its cycle as it returns 
		back to Primal Source for balance and a state of nonexistence or “home”.

		<span class="style5" lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">
		The Light/Harmonics Spectrum is just that, a spectrum of gradient levels 
		with each of the two primal energies having many different vibratory 
		stages. This is before even reaching the denser realities of physical 
		creation. Each level is a complete separate system and is responsible 
		for creations that occur in its field. Remember the nonphysical levels 
		will be beyond our instrumental and mathematical capacity to decipher. 
		This is why this material is so important for there is no other way to 
		understand the building block properties of the universe. It must be 
		understood that we only see a fraction of the smallest part of all that 
		there is, and the best of mathematics cannot decipher what exists beyond 
		measurement. To use mathematics in multi-universal context you would 
		need two opposing formulas, one in our reality while the other was in 
		the second reality. Even with this you would need the perspective of the 
		third and higher reality to make sense of the other two formulas and 
		their interactions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
