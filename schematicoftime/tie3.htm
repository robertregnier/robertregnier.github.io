Recognition of these edges is simply a matter of connecting to them by mimicking their shape. So the shape establishes the connection.

		<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">The same is true with the labyrinth (fig #2). This structure creates a connection to a group of harmonics. The labyrinth design also allows the ability to choose direction and this creates a different flavour. The centerline acts as a common link. Walking in this pattern joins and connects many harmonic structures of like kind. Walking is not the only way to connect. Our minds and thoughts create the effect by desire. Reiki symbols also provide the same &quot;dial up ability&quot;. Like the labyrinth the Reiki symbol Cho Ku Ray (fig #3) has two directions that create a connection to different qualities. The Cho Ku Ray shown in figure 3 is drawn clockwise and is said to connect to the heavens. The Native Americans call this direction the masculine energy. If drawn counter clockwise, the connection is towards the earth or the receptive feminine energy. This is just one aspect using physical symbols with larger universal connections. The shape, placement, and alignment with other objects is crucial. Desire, intent, and spiritual awareness from the practitioner are also used to form creations without time lag. In figure 1 examples are shown of structures and their respective connections to different grid structures. Stonehenge &quot;B&quot; replicates a two dimensional plane, while the steps in pyramid &quot;C&quot; actually connect on three dimensional levels. Both are right because space is not a factor here.</font><br />

		<span class="style20" style="mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">A </span><span class="style22" style="mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">vortex is a point with dual realities, containing great energy potential and coordinating points where realities merge. These are main coordinate points, pure mathematically, sources of fantastic energy, with vast numbers of subordinate coordinate points. There are four absolute coordinate points that intersect all realities. These coordinate points also act as channels through which energy flows and as warps or invisible paths from one reality to another. They also act as transformers and provide much of the generating energy that makes creation continuous in our terms. <br />
		<br />
		I do recommend that before you do any work in these areas that you first know yourself. This may seem on the surface to be a simple statement but it is not that simple. The majority of people on this planet do not understand real reality or how we create everything on a minute by minute basis. They are unaware of the incredible power that they have and how all of it is contained and controlled by one&#39;s beliefs and consciousness. This power that we have and use every minute of every day is accelerated in creative swiftness at these coordinate points or vortex areas. This is why; not understanding your beliefs and how they serve you can place you into uncomfortable situations when working in such intense spots. <br />
		<br />
		This was demonstrated recently at one of the large petroform sites in Manitoba called Tie Creek when a small group of people decided to spend the night there. <span style="line-height: 115%; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The night was so stressful for them that they found themselves hiking back in the dark out of these backwoods for miles; and then down a highway for several more miles to find a place to finish the night.</span><br />
		<br />
		All the emotions come into play at these sacred power sites including manifesting our fears, spiritual uncertainty and our self-judgment or self-criticism. Also, if you are open and ready to receive but have not done your 
		&quot;homework&quot;, this amount of energy and the acceleration can also be uncomfortable. Some people have experienced headaches caused by this acceleration. The most famous person was Thomas Jefferson, president of the Unite States. He built his estate right in the middle of a large octagon shaped Hopewell mound. He complained of constant headaches and in 1819 wrote &quot;I slumber without fear, and review in my dreams the vision of antiquity&quot;.<br />
		<br />
		Our surrounding space is also filled with subordinate points and is important in allowing us to transform thoughts and emotions into physical matter. When a thought or emotion attains a certain intensity it automatically attracts the power of one of these subordinate points and is therefore highly charged and in one way magnified, though not in size.<br />
		<br />
		These points impinge upon what you call time as well as space. Therefore, there are certain points in time and space that are more conducive than others. Practically speaking, this means that buildings will last longer in your context, that ideas wedded to form will be relatively eternal. The pyramids, for example, are a classic example of longevity.<br />
		<br />
		</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><span class="style22" style="mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">These coordinate points (absolute, main, or subordinate) represent accumulations or traces of pure energy. If you are thinking in terms of size (minute to an extreme) they are smaller than any particle that our scientists know. However, they are composed of pure energy and this energy must be activated. It is dormant until then and it cannot be activated physically. This is important to understand. Performing ceremonies at these sites has little to no effect on what is trying to be accomplished. The ceremony only serves to enforce the illusion that directly will affect the emotional impute, thus allowing a connection to the energy. <br />
		<br />
		There is an ever-so-minute alternation of the forces in the neighborhood of all of these points. Even the subordinate one and all the so-called physical laws to some extent or another will be found to have a wavering effect in these neighborhoods. The subordinate points also serve in a way as supports, as structural intensifications widen the unseen fabric of energy that forms all realities and manifestations. While there are traces or accumulations of pure energy there is a great difference between the amount of energy available in the various subordinate points and between the main and the absolute points.<br />
		<br />
		Therefore, these are points of concentrated energy. The subordinate points are far more common and practically speaking, affect your daily concerns. There are better places than others to build houses or structures - points where health and vitality are strengthened, where other things being equal, plants will grow and flourish and where all beneficial conditions seem to meet. In a given room providing that both areas contain the necessary requirement of light, plants will grow more effectively in a particular area than in other areas, providing that both areas contain such necessary requirements as light.</span></span><span class="style18" style="mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><span class="style21" style="mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><br style="mso-special-character:line-break" />

They occur within certain angles made by coordinate points. The points obviously are not themselves physical, that is, they are not visible, though they may be mathematically deduced. They are felt, however, as intensified energy. All of our space is permeated by these coordinate points so that certain invisible angles are formed. These angles are what some call the Earth Grid or even Sacred Geometry. <br />
		<br />
		This is highly simplified, but some angles will be more &quot;on the outskirts&quot; than others and will be less favorable for all conditions of growth and activity. In speaking of these angles, we will treat them as three-dimensional, though they are of course multidimensional. They will seem to be stronger during certain times than other times, though these differences have nothing to do with either the nature of the coordinate points or with the nature of time. These &quot;certain times&quot; are more of an add-on effect that can flavour original energy. One of the most effective time correlations would be during certain celestial alignments. Other elements also affect them but we need not be concerned with these now.<br />
		<br />
		The concentrated energy points are activated by emotional intensities that are well within your normal range. Your own emotions or feelings will activate these coordinates whether you know of them or not. Greater energy will therefore be added to the original thought or feeling and its projection into physical matter accelerated. Now this applies regardless of the nature of the feeling; only its intensity is involved here. So if the emotional intensity is what we would view as negative, then that is what the outcome will be. The emotional intensity is obviously dependent on the person or persons involved. It is important to understand that by doing energy work or ceremonies at the ancient sites will change the site energy. You are not the people that created the site no matter how much you relate to them. <br />
		<br />
		These points are like invisible power plants activated when any emotional feeling or thought of sufficient intensity comes into contact. The points themselves intensify whatever activates them in a quite neutral manner.<br style="mso-special-character:line-break" />

These exist &#39;beneath&quot; the range of physical matter. They are, if you prefer, incipient particles that have not yet emerged into matter. These units are natural emanations from all kinds of consciousness. They are the invisible formations resulting from reaction to any kind of stimuli. They very seldom exist in isolation, but unite under certain laws. They change both their form and their pulsation. This can be demonstrated by the fact that physical light is known to be both a wave and a particle. Their relative &quot;duration&#39; depends upon the original intensity behind them - that is, behind the original thought, emotion, stimuli, or reaction that brought them into being. Also the repetition of the ceremony or thought over a long period of time will come into play as this will produce a layering effect of energy.</span><br class="style23" />

		<span class="style23">Again, highly simplified here, under certain conditions these coagulate into matter. Those electromagnetic units are of high enough intensity automatically activate the subordinate coordinate points of which I have spoken. They are, therefore, accelerated and propelled into matter far more quickly, in our terms, than units of lesser intensity. Molecules would appear as large as planets to these units. Atoms and molecules and planets and these electromagnetic energy units are simply different manifestations of the same principles that bring the units themselves into being. It is only your relative position, your focus within an apparent space and time, that makes this seem so unlikely.</span><br class="style23" />
		<br class="style23" />
		<span class="style23">Each thought or emotion therefore exists as an electromagnetic energy unit or as a combination of these under certain conditions, and often with the help of coordinate points they emerge into the building blocks of physical matter. This emergence into matter occurs as a neutral &quot;result&quot; regardless of the nature of any given thought or emotion. Mental images, accompanied by strong emotion, are blueprints therefore upon which a corresponding physical object, or condition or event, will in our terms appear. In other words if you had strong enough emotions in the &quot;right&quot; place you could manifest a devil, a Mother Mary, ghost or even a burning bush. The intensity of a feeling or thought or mental image is, therefore, the important element in determining its subsequent physical materialization. The intensity is the core about which the electromagnetic energy units form. <br />
		<br />
		In our terms, the more intense the core, the sooner the physical materialization. This would apply whether the mental image was a fearful one or a joyful one. Now there is a very important problem here: If your turn of mind is highly intense and you think in vivid mental emotional images, these will be swiftly formed into physical events. If you are also of a highly pessimistic nature, given to thoughts and feelings of potential disaster, then these thoughts will be quite faithfully reproduced in experience. The more intense your imagination and inner experience, therefore, the more important it is that you realize the methods by which this inner experience becomes physically real. Your thoughts and emotions begin their journey into physical actualization at the moment of conception. <br />
		<br />
		If you happen to live in an area where the coordinate environment is strong, one of those areas I have spoken of as unusually conducive, then it will seem that you are deluged by illnesses or disasters, if these are the nature of your thoughts, because all thought is so fertile in this 
		environment. If, on the other hand, your feelings and subjective experience are fairly well balanced, fairly optimistic and creative in a constructive manner, then it will seem to you that you have been blessed with unusual luck, for your pleasant suppositions will come to pass so quickly. This is why these areas are called &quot;intense areas&quot;. They literally intensify creation by speeding up (in our perception) what you are capable of on an intellectual, emotional, and physic level. </span><br class="style23" style="mso-special-character:line-break" />

The coordinates activate the generating behavior of atoms and molecules, and greatly encourage their cooperative abilities; their tendency to swarm, so to speak, into organizations and structural groupings. The coordinate points magnify or intensify the behavior, the latent spontaneity inherent within the properties of physical matter. They act as psychic generators, propelling what is not yet physical into physical <br />
		<br />
		These emanations in varying degrees rise from all consciousness, not simply your own. This includes cellular consciousness as well, so that an invisible network of electromagnetic units pervades your entire atmosphere; and upon this web work (or Grid) and from it, the particles of physical matter are then formed. This can be compared almost to a wadding-up of air. This pocketing-of-space effect can also be perceived in certain trance states. </span><![endif]><br />

		<br />
		Sit quietly with your eyes closed and try to ascertain the directional proximity of main or subordinate coordination points. Here are some aids to help you. With the intent in mind, you will find your inner vision inclining toward a particular direction of the room, and even your thoughts will seem to follow in the same direction. An imaginary line will help you properly identify the place, in any given location, closest to any given coordination point. Imagine a line drawn from the point of your inner vision, coming from the inner eye you seem to be using, outward. Let it be joined by an imaginary line from the top of your skull, following the same direction in which your thoughts seem to flow. You have an imaginary line, then, in this case, from here, and here. There is an angle, and then both lines form together. They will point unerringly to the direction closest to a coordination point. The subordinate points permeate space and will vary in size. Sometimes the angle will be longer, but the two lines will point in the right direction. </span><br class="style22" />
