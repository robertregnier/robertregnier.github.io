		are basically two kinds of imprinted energy left on artifacts and sacred 
		sites. The first is a personal imprint of the creator or creators of the 
		artifact/site. Imprinting can be personal physical experiences, soul 
		level needs, or a combined need of a group; as in the case of the sacred 
		sites or Cache Blade collections. The second imprinted energy can be 
		from the artifact finder or anyone that has owned it after that. <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">That includes the &quot;new owners&quot; of a sacred site. I</span>n this 
		group you can receive impressions from everyone who has touched or 
		handled the object or created within the sacred site. This 
		type of imprinting is what often makes reading an artifact/site difficult 
		because the images can be so plentiful and varied that they come out 
		jumbled or skewed into one direction. The third imprinting is the one 
		I’m currently interested in. This imprinting is found in the creative 
		soul energy level, the one that created the human conscious level and 
		the need to express this level in the physical. As you know, life and 
		all objects do not just appear in the physical without the nonphysical 
		orchestrating it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

		Attuning to the object/place and the energy associated with it is a lot 
		like rewinding and replaying a tape. Often, the reproduction can be 
		quite accurate and faithful to the events imprinted on the object or 
		spot, but one must remember that they can think very differently than we 
		do today. The receiver can also be tapping into their fears, strengths, 
		and limitations. To make this process even more confusing, the receiver 
		may also be coloring the messages with their own modern belief systems. 
		One must always be aware when contacting sources closer to the physical 
		that you can get really different mental awareness abilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

		What is the trick to extracting from a site or artifact that you 
		consider important? The first part of the method is to understand the 
		level in which you are searching. This vibrational level will always be 
		specific to the energetic vibrational layer imprinted in the artifact or 
		site. If your meditation is light and just above the physical layer, 
		then this is the level of information you will tap into. If on the other 
		hand you go very deep and present the appropriate desire to understand, 
		this will head you in the right direction. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: silver; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
		In the three paragraphs below there are instructions that I have been 
		given on accessing creative levels. This may be a help for some that can 
		interpret the message. This method can also be used for sourcing out new 
		inventions, art, music, and so on. Remember, this information is from a 
		nonphysical level so it might not be understood by all: <o:p></o:p></p>

		``Consciousness is a band of energy that can be found in layers just 
		like the shells mentioned previously. Layering occurs because common 
		vibration finds common attraction; this includes desire, intelligence, 
		and emotional quotients. Layering occurs after any thought has arisen; 
		from there it naturally pools or gravitates to common vibrational arenas 
		within the matrix of universal dimensions. Exchanges of thought by all 
		sentient beings as well as pooling of common thought collect in pockets 
		and it’s in these pockets of energy that one can tap into. These pockets 
		remain in their respected consciousness vibrational levels called shells 
		(see “The Schematic of God” for more). <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">
		<span class="style2" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">This 
		banding or shells create matrix patterns of “individual thought 
		patterns” that can and do overlap. This overlapping also creates a 
		matrix pattern that is divided by the specific boundaries of the pattern 
		sector itself or individual likeness. In other words the individual 
		realties are only capable of intersecting or tapping into that which is 
		of common vibration or similar that allows them to reach into slightly 
		different vibrational fields. Because of this reaching ability you can, 
		in your reality, extend out into the higher or lower bands by raising or 
		lowering your vibration to the level of choice. Tapping into music, art, 
		scientific inventions are all achieved in this manner, whether one is 
		conscious of it or not. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">
		<span class="style2" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Start 
		by finding the common desire and intent in your emotional field. Follow 
		it up or down <u>after connection is secured</u>, once a vibrational 
		shift has been felt – Let Go! Absorb this background energy letting go 
		of all thoughts, questions, and interest in where or what is coming 
		through. This process will lead you to the information you seek. You can 
		ask for help in the learning stages for there are many that would love 
		to assist. Everyone in all levels understands evolution of spirit! ``<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: silver; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
		For artifact connection, hold the artifact in one hand and a “Tool” in 
		the other (typically left is receiving and right is transmitting). Tools 
		are bridges that help us connect to different levels (more is explained 
		in the “Tools Page”). Ask a question of the artifact or remain in 
		listening mode for the messages. This silence part is not as silent as 
		you realize for your needs and questions are always there. By remaining 
		silent rather than asking “intelligent” questions you will probably 
		receive far more than you would ever anticipate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		</span>Everyone and everything has a different energy because everything 
		has a different evolutionary level and a complimentary vibration that 
		makes them unique. <o:p></o:p></p>

		music creates a clearer thought or a focused state. This might not work 
		for everyone but for me, music is best chosen in another language or no 
		lyrics at all. Words that I can understand distract me and create a 
		tangent towards the thought of the song’s subject. I also put as many 
		varied types of music in the CD player as possible for I rarely know 
		what type of music will work the best for the night’s journey. Balanced 
		music is a connective creation from the nonphysical (regardless of 
		whether the artist is aware of this or not). This vibration or sound 
		will key one into the different levels for it all originates from the 
		universe. It will take you away and with the combination of the 
		artifact’s energy, the direction or energy angle will be spontaneously 
		found. This is all an automatic process, you will find the level of 
		answers required, and a year later you will probably find another level 
		of the same answers. This is the evolution of consciousness and the 
		growth that all sentient beings strive for. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
