		<p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span class="style2" style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">I</span><span class="style2"> began to consider why and even how these people knew where to place them. I began to compile data. It appeared that the depth of the strength of the grids varied. Somewhere 300ft others a tad slight more shallow. Yet when I tracked them they could run for miles, straight across the land with slight lifting periodically here and across other where only 1 foot and a half. Some of the ley lines seem to just abruptly end after miles. Yet when I would switch from earth plane viewing to soul travel view I could see they traveled infinitum cross vectoring and changing their subtly as they switched to the different levels and dimensional manifestation. Only in several places did the ley lines actually cease. Now, viewing these manifestations on the Time Line gird is a whole other experience, of which is not what this article is about.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
		<p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span class="style2" style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">T</span><span class="style2">o continue in the vein of this writing, I now began to wonder how these people knew where to place these shrines. I interviewed most all of the creators of these testaments to faith and spirit and in every case when I asked why they placed their shrines in that particular spot the over amazing reply was that, &quot;God told them&quot; or that the, &quot;Blessed Virgin&quot; said that were to put it. When I asked them how they heard this they said they prayed to have a guidance of where it should be.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
		<p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><br class="style2" />
		<span class="style2">Interestingly, enough some said too that they heard a high pitch whine when they got right on the exact spot. When they would divert to any other direction the tonal pitch would weaken or waiver. So, ley lines, also have tonal qualities as well. I was skeptical, at best. Remember these were my &quot;scientific&quot; days the days where tangle earth plane proof was required to make it legitimate. Course, eventually, I did out grow that rather limited definition of &quot;real&quot;--It much more education and informative to be out of such a rigid confine. Universe saw to that by giving me an assortment of abilities and experiences, as is always how soul lessons go here upon the earth plane. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
		<p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span class="style2" style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">I</span><span class="style2">t then became apparent, while gathering my data, as to why over the thousands of years of human civilization and cultures, why there where sacred grounds, places and monuments, etc. Graveyards are nothing more than chosen places to place our departed, but they are designated places nonetheless and consider hallow ground. Churches, synagogues, temples and all holy meeting places are usually built on consecrated ground. The reason? To uplift human consciousness at that gathering place. Haven&#39;t you ever felt exalted sitting in a sacred place? Well, it more tan just a psychologically association as to why you are feeling that--its the ley lines underneath you!<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

They mark, for their creators, special spots or places where they will frequent most oft and leave in an elevated state of either awareness or peace. These are the places of harnessed and unbridled Universal flux. The East Indians called these places, tantrapieds. Nothing is more relaxing to me than the traditional oriental garden with its bridge over a body of water.

All around me were other fibers or lines of light, whizzing by. I was traveling through the grid, along the aka web.”</em></span><span class="style6"><em> He goes on to say: “Far above me and slightly to one side, I perceived a shape that was roughly circular. It looked both reflective and opaque at the same time, constantly shifting back and forth between one state and the other. I noted that the fiber I was following was headed right for it. As I began to move across a bright, misty region, it seemed to resolve itself into units- into uncountable numbers of lights, looking somewhat like tiny, glowing bubbles or globes. As I got closer, each took on the appearance of an elliptical milky orb within which a brilliant “X” or cross formed a denser, central core. My perception abruptly shifted, and the plan appeared to me like a great matrix composed of endless numbers of luminous bubbles, each enclosing a neon cross, all fitted together intro a definite, composite whole, like endless cluster of tiny grapes.”&nbsp; </em> </span></p>

These are not insignificant roads as they have a thickness of 2 feet to 7 feet with a width up to 30 feet and paved with lime. That is as wide as a modern highway (not bad for a people that did not have the wheel for transportation). Like other ancient roads (Hopewell, Anasazi, Nazca, etc.) these followed the earth grid lines to junction points (in this case pyramid locations). To the knowledgeable ancients, it was so important to follow the grid lines and stay connected to the energy that topography was ignored or altered. Above is a perfect example of this, Lake Macanxoc was in the way. Rather than just going around it they went through it (shown in red circles). You can only imagine how much work that would be to fill a part of a lake without modern bulldozers.

As we turned towards the Macanxoc Group my friend noticed an energy flow, at which time I also picked it up. As we walked down Sacbeh # 9 toward the Macanxoc Group the energy grew stronger and stronger. I have felt a lot of different energies at ancient sites but this was OUTSTANDING! It was like a strong wind, without the physical blowing. I tried different experiments along the trail but it was on the walk back that I realized the energy had quit.

As time goes on the grid shifts and the row must be adjusted, thus a curve is created, more time more curve. This is the same reason why the ancient Maya rebuilt their pyramids every 52 years. The new angles in the shifting Universal Structure meant changing the direction of your physical rock arrangement or pyramid. Over great lengths of time the structure just had to be abandoned for logistical reasons. Through neglect and accumulated grid shifting the structure stopped producing the same effectiveness; understanding would also be lost in this transformational period.

		<i>&quot;The Chacoan roads are the linear features fanning out from the lower right hand corner. The yellow lines are current day roadways. The current roads follow topography, and the path of least resistance in construction. Conversely, the prehistoric roads are strikingly linear.<br />
		<br />
		The Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) was flown by NASA over Chaco Canyon for the first time in spring of 1982. TIMS measures temperature differences near the ground, it has five meter resolution prehistoric roads from 900 or 1000 AD were detected. The roads could not be discerned by the naked eye from ground level. They also could not be seen in either aerial photography or color infrared photographs. Three more flights over Chaco detected over 200 miles of a prehistoric roadway system, as well as prehistoric walls, buildings, and agricultural fields. It may be that Chaco Canyon was a social and religious center. People were coming exchanging ideas, practicing ritualistic activities, such as breaking pottery, and then returning to whence they came.<br />
		<br />
		Why were the Chaco roads designed with exacting linearity, which surmounted any topographic obstruction, built to a width of 20 feet or more, and constructed by people who did not even employ beast of burden in their lives?<br />
		The Chacoan roadway system was an impressive accomplishment that facilitated widespread movement and participation in religious activities. They connected the people along the periphery of the San Juan Basin and beyond to sacred places upon the landscape, to outlier sites, and ultimately to Chaco Canyon itself.T</i><br />
		<br />
		<i>Earthworks are often physically associated with roads as they approach great houses. These features, composed of mixed midden and fill, appear to be placed so as to delineate an area surrounding a great house. They may therefore be more closely related to great house function than to road function, but they do serve to clearly delineate where roads enter great house sites. Similarly, a few large platforms composed of earth and rubble have been associated both with great house features and with roads. These platforms are so rare that no clear patterning can be identified (e.g., Vivian 1995; Nials et al. 1987:16).<br />
		<br />
		While confirming the existence of long, continuous roadways emanating from Chaco Canyon has proven to be a difficult endeavor, archaeologists have identified an increasing number of short and seemingly unconnected road segments located throughout the northern Southwest.</i></span><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black;mso-themecolor:
