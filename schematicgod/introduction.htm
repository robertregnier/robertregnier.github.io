						have always been present among the populace. They are 
						usually loners by choice for they know on all levels 
						they are different than others. Most keep their 
						abilities to themselves. Not that there is anything to 
						hide from trusted friends and family, it usually stems 
						from difficulties in communicating to others what they 
						have seen and understand. Communicating their 
						understandings and explorations are usually too much for 
						some and uninteresting for others. The experiences 
						themselves galvanize the mystic to their work. Work, for 
						me is a word that keeps this serious &quot;play&quot; from getting 
						too obsessive. Going out of body or seeing crystal clear 
						images (Remote Viewing) of environments that are not 
						part of your daily life can be too emboldening to quit. 
						Added to the mystics dysfunction, is that any part of 
						domestic life becomes mundane and predictable, in 
						comparison. </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">Mystics use their abilities in 
						different ways and for different reasons. In the past, 
						the words these people could use to describe what they 
						had seen would have to find its source in the culture of 
						the day. These past cultures were submersed in nature 
						and the natural world, body, soul, and mind. In 
						interpreting the &quot;out of body experience&quot; (OBE) they 
						could only extract words originating in nature’s 
						expression. An example would be; if a cycle was 
						observed, it could be described as a snake swallowing 
						its tail (the Ouroboros). Try placing yourself there, if 
						you wanted to describe a cycle, say the cycle of life, 
						how would you do it? Of course all this in a culture 
						that had not developed the concept of a wheel. The only 
						way you could effectively do this is to use metaphors. 
						It is these metaphors that have been passed down to us. 
						It is also the metaphors that we focus on and think, 
						&quot;man they didn’t have a clue&quot;. The mystics knew, it was 
						just a lack of language to describe the impossible. In 
						this modern day and age we have computers and electrical 
						devices that alone, expand our language in unimaginable 
						ways to the ancient mind. This expanded language allows 
						us to communicate in more descriptive ways, a process 
						that does not fit into the &quot;norm&quot; natural world. Even 
						the simplest words like atoms, particle waves, 
						microwaves, dimensions, black holes, gravity, and so on 
						represent concepts the ancient mystics could have used 
						if they were available. </font></p>

						<p><font color="#000000">Yet here we are in the 
						twentieth century and we are still struggling to 
						understand. The truth is that even the wildest 
						scientific imagination could not begin to come close to 
						the truth of &quot;Real Reality&quot;. There is nothing in this 
						modern culture that can come close to the incredible 
						design of the universe never mind what lies beyond the 
						physical. When the truth is eventually accepted by the 
						world, almost all the known understandings and beliefs 
						will have to be abandoned due to obsoleteness. Every 
						scientific field will have to be scrapped or redesigned 
						so much so, that the fields may even be called something 
						else. It all depends on the time it will take to be 
						accepted. Typically this would take a few generations to 
						happen, but before this can take place the mystics have 
						to inject or seed the human consciousness with the 
						truth. This is and has always been the role of the 
						mystic, the one that usually keeps to the background, 
						like &quot;wallpaper&quot;. The mystic is the translator, the 
						message carrier, the bridge between cultural beliefs and 
						the true nature of &quot;All That Exists&quot;. </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">The most important aspect the 
						mystic must preserve is accuracy in interpreting the 
						information. Accuracy has been the biggest problem 
						facing a mystic, it is not that mystics are ethically 
						challenged, it is a matter of understanding with the 
						limitations of the human mind. Mystics are exposed to 
						the knowledge and the experiences. To those who 
						understand the experience, their accuracy is also only 
						relevant to the &quot;language&quot; they can communicate with 
						others. Now add to this cultural dogma, beliefs of &quot;ones 
						self&quot;, fears, insecurities, general health, and greed 
						and power issues. You can take any information and run 
						it through the above &quot;filters&quot; and you can see there 
						will always be different translations of the same 
						information. </font></p>
						<b>
						<p ALIGN="CENTER"><i><font color="#000000">It will be 
						done differently this time!</font></i></p>
						</b>
						<p><font color="#000000">I have looked at the new 
						subculture called New Age, and have seen how 
						half-truths, become complete truths, as time and the 
						story evolves. A partial truth is seeded, then becomes 
						the foundation of the next partial truth, then the next 
						is added, until the pyramid of what is true or not was 
						lost in the translation. New Age was a stepping-stone in 
						spirituality and like all stepping-stones you eventually 
						end up on the other side of the river, but you are still 
						at the rivers edge.</font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">Science has not faired much 
						better, for researchers find themselves in struggling to 
						keep one another from fudging the data or just plain 
						plagiarism of each others work, all in the name of 
						financial and political power. The all mighty dollar has 
						taken science out of the pure, independent, discovery 
						mode of the past. New instruments have allowed science 
						to see deeper and further into how wrong their old 
						outdated theories are. Unfortunately they have painted 
						themselves into a stifling box corner of maintenance of 
						these old partial truths. In other words science has 
						followed the same human pattern that New Age took, only 
						most in science don’t realize it yet. </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">Where do creationists and 
						religions fit into this nonphysical world? Unfortunately 
						they too have been diverted from their own great mystics 
						messages. A true religion cannot grow, they cannot 
						accept new mystics or their messages even from inside 
						their walls. To religion, mysticism died with the true 
						and pure of hearts of the past scholars. Today, one 
						religion sees all entering this world as unpurified, so 
						how could anyone be expected to be messengers of God, 
						unless they were high profile members. Even with this 
						status they are placed into a different category called 
						sainthood. Sainthood being defined as; follow their 
						example but don’t change anything! In fact religion in 
						itself fails to understand the messages that their own 
						originators brought to this world. Religion by its 
						nature and rules is bound by the ‘orthodox stand of 
						stagnation&quot;. It is not allowed to evolve so it ceases to 
						learn more of its own nature, humanity, and beauty. So 
						why do I come forward with my message if all is lost? 
						The truth is I know there are thousands of people out 
						there like me that just want to understand why and how 
						this reality works. What lies beyond the 5%, our 
						physical form, we call &quot;I&quot;. </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">Archaeology and interest in the 
						past, first developed in my high school years. From 
						there I achieved a federal grant for an archaeological 
						research project. It was during these times that I 
						became fascinated with the past and past cultures. From 
						this interest, I like many others, found out the 
						ancients had abilities we are still trying to 
						understand. When developing an interest in the past, one 
						always ends up asking why and how, with few obtainable 
						answers. Why were some of the ancient cultures so 
						advanced and yet they disappeared? Is humanity so 
						shallow that we cannot retain what we have learned? It 
						can appear this way for anyone that studies history. 
						There had to be better answers than what the current 
						history books and popular researchers were offering. I 
						needed to find out, but could not turn to current 
						theories, for these theories all give you the feeling of 
						being &quot;straws to grasp onto&quot;. I ended up deciding that I 
						was the only one that could find answers to my 
						questions. I had to do it, not so much by myself, but 
						for myself. You can always tell when the academics don’t 
						know the answers. They either avoid the question or they 
						make up something that is absolutely ridiculous. In fact 
						the only ones that would believe and propagate this 
						these ridiculous ideas would be news media, who blindly 
						follow along by spreading the misconceptions to the 
						public.</font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">Stonehenge is a perfect example 
						of a misconception that continues to be taught by the 
						news media (in conjunction with the &quot;straw grabbers&quot;). 
						The alignments, at these sites, as with most sites 
						around the earth, are simply to find a directional 
						position. They were never intended to align to the sun 
						or star for other reasons. In an age before maps and 
						compasses the sun was the best way to find direction. 
						After that was established, the real interesting work 
						began and the purpose behind it all. It was not to align 
						with gods, fertility, crop planting or any other 
						ridiculous theory. The truth is much more profound than 
						this. Those using only intellect will inevitably fail to 
						find the answers. I can tell you with complete 
						conviction that intellect did not create the reason or 
						purpose for the alignments at ancient site. This purpose 
						was downloaded to the ancient shamans/mystics in the 
						past, just as it can be today if you are interested in 
						learning. There is a reason for alignment but it is not 
						to gods or stars in the general sense of it. There is no 
						value in aligning to a star or an imaginary god that 
						produces no tangible results. Has anyone asked why would 
						this worldwide need last for a thousand years under such 
						an undemonstrative experience? There was a good reason 
						but this book will only give the basics to the 
						teachings. In fact this was probably the way it was done 
						thousands of years ago. The real reason is so complex 
						and &quot;directionally diversified&quot; in its entirety, that 
						only a preliminary explanation must be given at first. 
						You cannot learn a complex language without starting 
						with the basics. There is nothing in our present culture 
						or science’s knowledge base that can come close to 
						understanding the design. You first have to learn the 
						language before you can read the schematics. The 
						ancients did it this way and it probably took them 
						thousands of years to accumulate the understandings. I 
						can shortcut this because the work has already been 
						done. The knowledge is already a part of the human 
						physic’s background. It is an illusion to think that 
						discoveries are done in sequence of one another. Outside 
						this three-dimensional reality there is no time. So 
						discoveries are all there in their field of vibration. 
						Every time a new understanding enters this environment 
						called the present, it cascades backward and forward in 
						time. Discoveries can be picked out of the &quot;background&quot; 
						like fruit off a tree. Sequence of events for 
						discovering any piece of information is simply a matter 
						of how long your &quot;ladder&quot; is. If it is short then you 
						discoveries (the fruit) will be from the lower branches. 
						With each discovery your vibration in this &quot;field&quot; 
						increases, and you are adding another rung on the 
						ladder, this is the only sequence there is. The next 
						book of this series will show the process and the 
						benefits, for there is a real benefit to it all. (Or did 
						you think that many thousands of work hours and tons of 
						building material was worth aligning to the sun or 
						celestial object)? </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">In the current information age, 
						you can always tell which of the expert’s (each in their 
						own field), are dictating through intellect and not from 
						original thought or research. After reading their 
						material, there is the original &quot;fix&quot;, of hearing the 
						information, it is a short high that always leads to a 
						long hollow feeling afterward. The translation for this 
						‘fix&quot; feeling is; your questions are still unanswered. I 
						realized many years ago that science could not answer 
						the questions that I had about the ancient sites. They 
						did not have the tools or training to get to the real 
						sources, the people in the past that built the sites. I 
						needed to turn to unorthodox methods, the only answer 
						was metaphysics. Even in the metaphysical field, after 
						many years of reading and researching, I noticed a 
						crippling pattern. The pattern was that most authors 
						were following the previous one’s path. The perpetual 
						half-truth pyramid sequence is inevitable if you 
						continue to research others material prior to doing your 
						own research. Information is only a &quot;stepping-stone&quot;, 
						for it becomes information by virtue of comparing prior 
						base knowledge. If knowledge comes from creative 
						research as a base truth, and is recognized as original 
						in source creativity, it should be felt alone, to stand 
						on its own truth. Unfortunately too many recognize the 
						creative aspect of some knowledge and want to add to it 
						with their understandings and interpretations. This is 
						how it all goes astray, intellect is based on what a 
						person knows, and this is not always in alignment with 
						true creativeness. </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">In the beginning of this work I 
						was reading about 35 books a year. Then I realized 
						something after seen a pattern in the books. After this 
						period, I quit purchasing books because there was no 
						real substance in them. I realized they were all saying 
						the same thing, only in different ways. I decided to do 
						something about it, for my strength in the metaphysical 
						world was getting stronger. As I began my research, it 
						didn’t take me long to realize that I could find answers 
						faster than others could, that is if I isolated my 
						research from their beliefs. It also didn’t take long to 
						find myself isolated for the others in my life, falling 
						into the affliction of the &quot;mystic syndrome&quot;! I 
						continued growing and in doing so found myself 
						separating in common interests from my friends and 
						family. It isn’t that I turned to a monastic lifestyle, 
						it was that we now had little in common, as far as their 
						interests and mine were concerned. </font></p>
						<p></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">There is little information in 
						this book researched from the intellectual viewpoint. As 
						I have said, I learned a long time ago there is little 
						new growth in a collection of already known material, 
						even if it is woven into a new theory. Nonphysical 
						environments and sources have handed down all 
						information found in this book, to the extent that I 
						have also been informed on how long I will be in this 
						reality (I’m very comfortable with the knowledge). With 
						this information package I was told that I will be long 
						gone before this material is generally accepted. There 
						are a few motivations that push me speak out, first was 
						the realization that it took me fifty years to acquire 
						the skills I needed and seven years to gather this 
						information. The second reason is that I need to seed 
						the reality before I go. The third and most important 
						reason was a &quot;pact&quot; I had made to the sources that I 
						would share the knowledge, if I were allowed to have all 
						that I could comprehend. </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">If there is only one person out 
						there that can benefit from all this work of mine, then 
						it was worth the two and half years it took me to put it 
						down in text. All effort on both sides of this reality 
						must not go to waste. I’m seeking no accolades, power, 
						or monitory rewards from anyone. I just want this 
						information available for the next individual that can 
						use it. I will not discuss the material, nor will I 
						defend it or debate it, for it is what it is. I have 
						found that there will always be insecure intellectuals 
						that will try to debate, but this individual has no 
						interest, at all. People must understand that this is 
						not my information, it is knowledge from sources beyond 
						the physical. I also realize that this information will 
						have no effect on this present culture. There is no way 
						this culture can be turned around in the current lives 
						of this generation. Facing this realization, I must 
						write this book for the next generation and especially 
						for the generations after that. The new generations will 
						challenge the &quot;old order&quot; and they will dissolve most of 
						the present known ideas in science and cultural beliefs.
						</font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">This book is dedicated to the 
						next two generations. It is not realistically aimed at 
						this present generation. In this book, the language will 
						be simple and in very small increments of understanding. 
						I know what it was like to be young, bright, and have 
						nowhere to turn for answers. </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">To gather the information in 
						these books I have traveled to the very edge of this 
						universe and to some of the highest vibratory levels 
						possible, that is in the context of what the human mind 
						is capable of translating. I’m not the first to explore 
						the higher vibratory states. Many in the past have, and 
						records of their journeys are recorded in text. Arjuna 
						journeyed into these realms and the book called &quot;The 
						Bhagavad-Gita&quot; was created to show others what was 
						possible. Most mystics, many, who are alive today, 
						prefer just to remain silent. It is much easier to stay 
						quiet than to attempt such a feat, and feel that you now 
						must complete the understanding. I personally feel that 
						these deeper experiences would not be possible without 
						&quot;outside help&quot;. I truly believe that these higher states 
						of experience are gifts more than a talent. It is 
						because of this belief that I feel I need to share the 
						experiences. Readers will know what parts they need and 
						what information is usable to them. This information is 
						extensive and will encompass two books in its current 
						form. </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">Presently, the world is full of 
						partial or inadequate information, mainly because it was 
						rushed and not thoroughly researched from its roots 
						before it was released. Unconventional information 
						should not be injecting into the public’s attention 
						without being totally researched form its origins. If 
						the origins are not understood or known, the information 
						should state this fact. It takes years to acquire the 
						complete understanding, something most are not willing 
						to do. Many people today that acquire new information 
						are so excited to tell others that they fail to see 
						their role in this information. We need to begin with 
						the basics first. That is the only way the information 
						will not get distorted or warped into something else as 
						it travels from one interpretation to another, the 
						half-truths that produce more half-truths syndromes. The 
						information that I have received encompasses completely 
						new concepts of time, space, DNA, histories of humanity, 
						spirituality, ancient sites, and much more. Below is a 
						small sampling of questions that are answered in this 
						book. I have placed them here under categories for the 
						convenience of the readers.</font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">The information in our books is 
						totally unique to this reality, but not to global 
						consciousness. The mystics of the past all contributed 
						to the information in one-way or another. Some had small 
						parts, others had larger parts to play, each creating 
						their own unique version of the information and handing 
						it down to the collective human continuousness. It is 
						the mystics from the &quot;past&quot; that are the true inventors 
						and discoverers. Be it directly or indirectly in what 
						has been called the hundred-monkey syndrome. Some are 
						recognized today as genius, some are inventive, others 
						are called pure lucky. Whatever phylum you want to place 
						them in, it is the creative person, the artist that 
						makes the first discoveries. Every person alive is 
						capable of this and most do creative work even in their 
						own personal world, but the creative mind can only be 
						established by &quot;letting go&quot; to the universe. Each person 
						depending on their vibration will achieve their own 
						level of discovery. Each person, past or present, has 
						his or her particular &quot;direction&quot; to obtain knowledge. 
						If you decide to read this book I can assure you that 
						your vibration will be affected. You will rise in 
						spiritual levels that will, if you &quot;let go&quot; 
						sufficiently, create new experiential events for 
						yourself. These new spiritual experiences will create a 
						higher vibratory state for you to resonate with, if you 
						accept them as gifts. The more you &quot;accept&quot; and &quot;let 
						go&quot;, the more experiences will come to you. This is your 
						gift, a gift of validation, to yourself, proving there 
						is more to this reality then the preverbal &quot;I&quot;. </font>
						</p>
						<p><font color="#000000">If wondered why I said &quot;our 
						books&quot;, well I do have a partner that has helped me with 
						all of this over the past five years. She too has 
						experienced many levels beyond this reality and has full 
						memory of creative teachings in the period prior to her 
						life here in physical form. It is this background 
						knowledge of hers that I myself use as a filter to keep 
						from becoming sidetracked. It is easy to go off on a 
						tangent otherwise. She is also a contributing partner, 
						and at times has sent me off into understandings that I 
						did not originally get. </font></p>

						<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#000000">Problems with 
						ancient spiritual sites and ancient understandings:</font></p>
						</b>
						<p><font color="#000000">The last seven years are a 
						by-product of teaching learned from ancient spiritual 
						sites. I originally listened to the absolute lunatic 
						ideas about the ancient site designs and knew I needed a 
						real answer. The experts were saying the alignments of 
						the pyramids and stone circles around the world were to 
						tell the seasons for crops. This does not explain all 
						sites, for example; western Canada stone sites that were 
						built by nonagrarian people. There is also the theories 
						that they worshipped the gods in the sky, when most of 
						them &quot;lived&quot; in the underworld. We cannot whitewash 
						every culture and time period with the same brush. It 
						become obvious to me, they just did not know, but for 
						some reason they still had to come up with something, 
						even if it did not fit. There had to be a common link, a 
						common theme, or understanding. It was evident that we 
						as a race had lost this understanding for one reason or 
						another. </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">I did find the common link and 
						understanding but it was so different there is nothing 
						in this world that even hints of this direction. What I 
						was shown in my journeys gave unity to everything that 
						exists in this world. From the shape of our bodies, the 
						movements we make in our daily activities including 
						dancing, Yoga, Feng Shui, and all the way to our 
						spiritual heredity. The understandings were so totally 
						new that I needed to be taught the basic &quot;language&quot; 
						first before being shown the actual composition of this 
						knowledge. </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">I have found out through my 
						teachings that the alignments were to some celestial 
						objects, but not for gods or seasons. There was a more 
						beneficial reason that produced results for these 
						people. That is not to say that some preceding groups 
						did not find superstition and extracurricular reasons or 
						uses for the alignments. Even today many still worship 
						the seasonal equinoxes. Associations to seasons, nature, 
						celestial objects, and time periods have always been 
						part of humanity’s attention. Cultures observe the 
						cycles of life and the shifts throughout the year, but 
						they don’t run out there and make massive temples to 
						demonstrate their observation. It is obvious there was 
						more value to the temples than merely pointing at an 
						object in the sky! Below I have given just a small 
						number of questions answered by these understandings.
						</font></p>
						<ul>
							<li><font color="#000000">Why does humanity go

						Science:</font></p>
						</b>
						<p><font color="#000000">I have been told, &quot;science is 
						the study of tire tracks!&quot; I inquired to what that meant 
						and was told that in this field they observe, then 
						measure, record, classify, and study the results or 
						&quot;impressions&quot;. Physical results left in this physical 
						reality from a larger unseen source. The metaphor refers 
						to a factitious primitive culture that has come across 
						these strange tracks in the mud. In their culture none 
						have seen a motorized vehicle, so the concept of what 
						made the tracks is not available. In this factitious 
						tribe the most knowledgeable members decide to 
						investigate, using past understandings and observations. 
						As you can imagine the best of them conclude that 
						whatever made these tracks had to be round. So many 
						theories are put forward as to the possible shape and 
						appearance of this round object. Unfortunately time has 
						robbed them of the opportunity to witness the event. 
						With nothing to compare it to and only the physical 
						results to go on the initial theories are adopted as the 
						only truths available. As time goes on the theories 
						become part of the historical fact for the tribe, for 
						there is no need to question it anymore. </font></p>
						<p><font color="#000000">This is exactly what happened 
						in our modern scientific field. Most of the past 
						theories were only partially accurate or at best there 
						was nothing else offered that could explain the 
						&quot;tracks&quot;. The answer is the same as with the tribe 
						above, we mainly have been observing what is in the 
						physical. All that is created in the physical realm is a 
						result of processes and design that are not physical in 
						nature. Below are a small number of physical &quot;tire 
						tracks&quot; that are a serious problem for science to 
						understand. The answers are there, and these books will 
						show the nonphysical &quot;vehicles&quot;. </font></p>

							<li><font color="#000000">Why are the Pioneer 
							spacecraft’s veering off course toward the edge of 
							the solar system? Have they hit a wall that is 
							keeping them into our space capsule? Something is 
							holding the probes back, according to calculations 
							of their paths, speed and how the gravity of all the 
							objects in the solar system -- and even a tiny push 
							provided by sunlight -- ought to act on them.</font></li>

							<li><font color="#000000">In 1998, astronomers 
							discovered the universe is expanding at ever-faster 
							speeds. It's an effect still searching for a cause - 
							until then, everyone thought the universe's 
							expansion was slowing down after the big bang. 
							&quot;Theorists are still floundering around, looking for 
							a sensible explanation,&quot; says cosmologist Katherine 
							Freese of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</font></li>

							<li><font color="#000000">The team fired beryllium 
							nuclei at a small carbon target and analyzed the 
							debris that shot into surrounding particle 
							detectors. They expected to see evidence for four 
							separate neutrons hitting their detectors. Instead 
							the Ganil team found just one flash of light in one 
							detector. And the energy of this flash suggested 
							that four neutrons all arrived together at the same 
							time in the detector. Of course, their finding could 
							have been an accident: four neutrons might just have 
							arrived in the same place at the same time by 
							coincidence. But that's ridiculous and improbable, 
							or is it?</font></li>

						<ul>
							<li><font color="#000000">In our best understanding 
							of gravity, apply it to the way galaxies spin, and 
							you'll quickly see the problem: the galaxies should 
							be falling apart. Galactic matter orbits around a 
							central point because it’s mutual gravitational 
							attraction creates centripetal forces. But there is 
							not enough mass in the galaxies to produce the 
							observed spin, so what is the answer?</font></li>

							<li><font color="#000000">The University of Tokyo's 
							Akeno Giant Air Shower Array has detected several 
							cosmic rays above the GZK limit. In theory, they can 
							only have come from within our galaxy, avoiding an 
							energy-sapping journey across the cosmos. However, 
							astronomers can find no source for these cosmic rays 
							in our galaxy. So what is going on? Is Einstein 
							wrong in his special theory of relativity saying 
							that space is the same in all directions, but what 
							if particles found it easier to move in certain 
							directions? Then the cosmic rays could retain more 
							of their energy, allowing them to beat the GZK 
							limit.</font></li>

							<li><font color="#000000">Look across space from one 
							edge of the visible universe to the other, and 
							you'll see the microwave background radiation 
							filling the cosmos is at the same temperature 
							everywhere. That may not seem surprising until you 
							consider the two edges are nearly 28 billion 
							light-years apart and our universe is only 14 
							billion years old. So if nothing can travel faster 
							than the speed of light there is no way heat 
							radiation could have traveled between the two 
							horizons to even out the hot and cold spots. In the 
							big bang theory the thermal equilibrium we see now 
							is impossible. This &quot;horizon problem&quot; is a big 
							headache for cosmologists, so big that they have 
							come up with some ridiculous solutions or straw 
							grasping reactions.</font></li>
