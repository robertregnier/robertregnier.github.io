			<p><font size="6">T</font>he brain is capable of interpreting and 
			translating far more inner information than it appears to be doing. 
			It is the ego’s idea of what is possible, the ego’s concept of 
			reality, that determines in a large manner whether or not the brain 
			will interpret any particular data. Now some inner data cannot be 
			perceived or translated by the conscious part of the brain. What 
			happens is, as consciousness expands into new levels of awareness 
			new pathways develop to accommodate the new information, into a 
			translatable matter. In other words the more a mystic works with the 
			material the more clear and complete the material becomes. Basically 
			there is little difference as to the manner in which normal 
			perception or extrasensory perceptions are received. Both originate 
			in the nonphysical, it is our choice as to which one or both we want 
			to perceive in the physical. </p>
			<p>When Einstein was asked in reference to relativity, &quot;How did you 
			do it?&quot;, he replied, &quot;I ignored an axiom.&quot; This is exactly what 
			needs to happen, the next level of understanding is only waiting for 
			us to tire of this one. </p>
			<p>It is well documented that novices and academics who slip into 
			nonphysical reality for information, make most of the great 
			inventions and discoveries. This can include informative dreams, 
			being downloaded through an insightful moment (The &quot;aha&quot; spark, 
			called channeling), and visions. These injections into our reality 
			come from outside the human experience and intellect is usually 
			available to anyone listening. Typically, a few people hear the 
			message at once; they are usually the ones that are focused on the 
			problem prior to the insight. Of these few listeners, only one or 
			two will carry through with it and thus a discovery is made, 
			followed by the patent. It is well known that major discoveries are 
			done by more than one person in the same time period. They can be on 
			the other side of the planet, but both are connected to the 
			download, it is just a matter of which one registers their discovery 
			first. This pattern happens because the information’s source is 
			outside our physical reality and thus time and space are not part of 
			the equation. It does make one wonder how many past &quot;egos&quot; have 
			buried their story so that credit is given to their intellect. </p>
			<p>There are many recorded instances of this out of reality research 
			including most of Thomas Edison’s inventions. The German chemist 
			Friedrich Kekule, for instance, dreamed of a snake with its tail in 
			its mouth, and understood that the molecular structure of benzene 
			was a closed carbon ring. The French mathematician Jules-Henri 
			Poincaré, during a sleepless night, saw mathematical symbols 
			colliding until they coalesced into equations. This discover process 
			still goes no, even in the time frame of writing this chapter, 
			another scientist has just dreamed the impossible. It has been 
			physically impossible to make a dimmer switch for a florescent light 
			bulb. Scientist have worked on this for thirty years until this year 
			of 2006 a scientist dreamed the solution, went to his lab and 
			created the dimmer switch in a couple of hours. Most of these 
			&quot;accidental&quot; discoveries are done through the pattern of letting go. 
			The pattern flows as; saturating yourself in the subject at hand, 
			learning all you can, and thinking about it day and night. After 
			this period of time, lack of results will indefinitely result in 
			frustration, this is the perfect time to let go of it all. 
			Unfortunately some don’t know how to let go, because they have so 
			much invested. They usually &quot;die trying&quot;, while others abandon the 
			project, only to find themselves being downloaded with the knowledge 
			that they have been searching for. It’s as simple as that – Let Go! 
			It is pure logic, that if you search for the unknown you will not 
			find it in what you know!</p>
