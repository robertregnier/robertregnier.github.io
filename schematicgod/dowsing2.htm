		<p>Very few sites around the world show astronomical alignments 
		including &quot;assigned&quot; alignments. Without knowing the intent of the 
		designers or the exact date that they built these sites, all alignments 
		are pure guesswork. Astronomical alignments can be convenient. Without 
		knowing the exact date of the design you only have to search back to a 
		time that corresponds to an astronomical alignment, and presto, you have 
		your so-called alignment. No one can argue with you for they too are 
		guessing on the timeframe. To complicate things two or more cultures 
		usually have used these sites with the latest cultural changes being the 
		final product. By that time, the original knowledge is lost and the task 
		has just multiplies in difficulty.</p>
		<p>Within these sites dowsing is now showing properties that would have 
		been missed by conventional measurements. I feel that it is important to 
		show some of the findings so that others in the field might also come 
		across similar results and the pattern will be revealed. The more pieces 
		of this puzzle that comes to light, the more a complete picture will be 
		discovered.</p>
		<p>Above all, the Tie Creek features convinced me that the designers 
		knew something that we don't. The clue can be found outside the feature 
		with a set of dowsing rods. On the north-west side of Feature #1 is a 
		set of three energy lines that comprise a width of approximately 25 
		feet. This is not surprising because a major energy line runs through 
		the site at this point (see above diagram). This line connects to the 
		Wave site (Tie Creek Area Site #7 is .3 miles away) and continues on 
		through to the Alonsa/Glenella Petroform site (136 miles) ending up at 
		the Majorville Medicine Circle in Alberta (a distance of 743 miles). 
		Feature #1 at Tie Creek is built on the junction of energy &quot;grid&quot; lines 
		that converge at this spot. There are other energy line convergence 
		centers at the site but they belong to different geometric pattern systems. </p>
		<p>There are no obvious boulder alignments until dowsing rods are 
		applied. The dowsing will show energy lines running through stones and 
		boulders. It's only at that moment, standing on the individual lines 
		that other boulders come into visual alignment (as shown below in fig #1). You also have to take into consideration that this site is 
		thousands of years old and some of the stones shown in the diagrams have 
		been knocked out of their original placement. This is why some of the 
		stones are just touching the line or are in the general area.</p>

		When I first started dowsing at Tie Creek I found the site had energy 
		lines that crossed at the center of Feature #1. While working with the 
		124-degree line outside of this feature I was surprised to find the line 
		shift in direction. To the west of the site an odd shaped triangular 
		boulder of approximately two feet in diameter was placed in the middle 
		of the two 124 degree lines. This boulder could be just another stone 
		but dowsing rods show that it is in the center of two energy lines that 
		cross from the outside lines (see below).

		What actually happens is that the center 
		boulder splits or focuses the energy lines and connects the two outer 
		lines at that spot (see fig. #3 above. You could say that it was coincidental, 
		or that the energy pattern just happened that way until you examine the 
		center boulder. The boulder was hand picked or was shaped by fracturing 
		it into its present shape. Then it was aligned pointing down the energy 
		line so that the two facets or cleavages became &quot;lenses&quot; (the same as a 
		light prism) that projected the two crossover lines (see photo below). 
		To fracture this boulder would not be a small feat for it is composed of 
		pink granite. Someone made quite an effort to find or create this object

		<p>After seeing the dowsing results it didn’t take long to realize that 
		this site was &quot;layered&quot; in purpose and design. Energy was being 
		collected and directed to key positions and places. There will be more 
		on this as time allows but for now this is a good introduction for 
		researches to check other sites around the world. I have found that 
		there are generally three parallel energy lines that create a single 
		balanced line. Why I say balanced is that the energy follows a direction 
		with its &quot;partner line&quot; flowing in the opposite direction. This energy 
		is a harmonic and will follow the rules of harmonics. The third line is 
		the balanced state that exists in the middle or &quot;border edge&quot; of the two 
		lines of direction. It is the border between the two opposite harmonic 
		directions of flow. This middle energy line is in a balanced state of 
		neutrality. These are the three basic parts of one line&nbsp; that creates 
		with other similar lines to form the earth’s 
		grid. The earth's grid is not one singular geometric design. There are 
		many geometries involved and it all depends on what level you are 
		perceiving. In my book &quot;The Schematic of God&quot; there is much more information about this. </p>
		<p>Although the boulders do align in the direction of some astronomical 
		sources, they are only there to provide ordination on grander scales. To 
		demonstrate this, I picked out one of the boulders that would never be in 
		alignment to any astronomical object because it is pointing downhill. 
		The example of this is the standing triangle rock marked in the top 
		diagram as &quot;D&quot;. It is part of the 124 degree line. This line actually 
		goes downhill from the main feature at &quot;G&quot; which is also in alignment 
		with the &quot;Energy Prism Rock&quot;. </p>
		<p>It is all about energy and energy collection. Understanding this 
		energy what it is and how it was used will take time to explain. This is 
		why the book &quot;Schematic of God&quot; was created. </p>
		<p>One more note for researchers<span lang="en-ca">;</span> <span lang="en-ca">d</span>owsing 
		can also be supplemented with Remote Viewing of the site to extract more 
		knowledge. I have done many RVing sessions with this site and have many 
		experiences to draw from. The most memorable was viewing of a ceremony 
		taking place there in the past. As I watched this group of natives 
		walking in a line behind one another they turned to the right creating a 
		&quot;J&quot; pattern. It was at this point and time that the leader (a shaman) 
		was now facing me. He stopped than looked in &quot;my direction of view&quot; then 
		walked forward to my &quot;position&quot;. At that point he then stooped forward 
		and stared right into my face. This startled me so much that the session 
		was over due to my loss of focus. I cannot exaggerate how much fun there 
		is working with tools that allow this type of experience, never mind the 
		information that can be gleamed form it.</p>
