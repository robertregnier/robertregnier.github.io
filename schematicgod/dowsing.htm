		&nbsp;<p class="style7"><font size="6">T</font>here is a wealth of 
		information that could come from these ancient sites if researchers were 
		open to following the clues.  
		One <span lang="en-ca">of the best tools that can be used is D</span>owsing <span lang="en-ca">as it </span>can point out alignments 
		and features that would not be spotted otherwise. A good example is the 
		Tie Creek Site in the Manitoba Whiteshell area. The largest feature 
		there is Feature #1 (shown below) with a length of 110'10&quot; on the west 
		line and 128'3&quot; on the east line. This feature contains some very large 
		boulders with what seems to be arbitrary glacial erratics (stones) 
		spread around the outside of the feature. Archaeologists have tried to 
		make sense of them with only one possible alignment connected to the 
		feature and a celestial object. </p>
		<font class="style7">

		<p align="center">In the diagram above the letters mark points of topic, 
		click for larger scale.</p>
		<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Very few sites around the world show astronomical alignments 
		including &quot;assigned&quot; alignments. Without knowing the intent of the 
		designers or the exact date that they built these sites, all alignments 
		are pure guesswork. Astronomical alignments can be convenient. Without 
		knowing the exact date of the design you only have to search back to a 
		time that corresponds to an astronomical alignment, and presto, you have 
		your so-called alignment. No one can argue with you for they too are 
		guessing on the timeframe. To complicate things two or more cultures 
		usually have used these sites with the latest cultural changes being the 
		final product. By that time, the original knowledge is lost and the task 
		has just multiplie<span lang="en-ca">d</span> in difficulty.</p>
		<p>Within these sites dowsing is now showing properties that would have 
		been missed by conventional measurements. I feel that it is important to 
		show some of the findings so that others in the field might also come 
		across similar results and the pattern<span lang="en-ca">s</span>. The more pieces 
		of this puzzle that comes to light, the more a complete picture will be 
		discovered.</p>
		<p>Above all, the Tie Creek features convinced me that the designers 
		knew something that we don't. The clue can be found outside the feature 
		with a set of dowsing rods. On the north-west side of Feature #1 is a 
		set of three energy lines that comprise a width of approximately 25 
		feet. This is not surprising because a major energy line runs through 
		the site at this point (see above diagram). This line connects to the 
		Wave site (Tie Creek Area Site #7 is .3 miles away) and continues on 
		through to the Alonsa/Glenella Petroform site (136 miles) ending up at 
		the Majorville Medicine Circle in Alberta (a distance of 743 miles). 
		Feature #1 at Tie Creek is built on the junction of energy &quot;grid&quot; lines 
		that converge at this spot. There are other energy line convergence 
		centers at the site but they belong to different geometric pattern systems. </p>
		<p>There are no obvious boulder alignments until dowsing rods are 
		applied. The dowsing will show energy lines running through stones and 
		boulders. It's only at that moment, standing on the individual lines 
		that other boulders come into visual alignment (as shown below in fig #1). You also have to take into consideration that this site is 
		thousands of years old and some of the stones shown in the diagrams have 
		been knocked out of their original placement. This is why some of the 
		stones are just touching the line or are in the general area.</p>

		&nbsp;</p>
		<p>When I first started dowsing at Tie Creek I found the site had energy 
		lines that crossed at the center of Feature #1. While working with the 
		124-degree line outside of this feature I was surprised to find the line 
		shift in direction. To the west of the site an odd shaped triangular 
		boulder of approximately two feet in diameter was placed in the middle 
		of the two 124 degree lines. This boulder could be just another stone 
		but dowsing rods show that it is in the center of two energy lines that 
		cross from the outside lines (see below). </p>

		<font class="style7">
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>What actually happens is that the center 
		boulder splits or focuses the energy lines and connects the two outer 
		lines at that spot (see fig. #3 above. You could say that it was coincidental, 
		or that the energy pattern just happened that way until you examine the 
		center boulder. The boulder was hand picked or was shaped by fracturing 
		it into its present shape. Then it was aligned pointing down the energy 
		line so that the two facets or cleavages became &quot;lenses&quot; (the same as a 
		light prism) that projected the two crossover lines (see photo below). 
		To fracture this boulder would not be a small feat for it is composed of 
		pink granite. Someone made quite an effort to find or create this object 
		and had a very specific use for it. </p>

		<p>After seeing the dowsing results it didn’t take long to realize that 
		this site was &quot;layered&quot; in purpose and design. Energy was being 
		collected and directed to key positions and places. There will be more 
		on this as time allows but for now this is a good introduction for 
		researches to check other sites around the world. I have found that 
		there are generally three parallel energy lines that create a single 
		balanced line. Why I say balanced is that the energy follows a direction 
		with its &quot;partner line&quot; flowing in the opposite direction. This energy 
		is a harmonic and will follow the rules of harmonics. The third line is 
		the balanced state that exists in the middle or &quot;border edge&quot; of the two 
		lines of direction. It is the border between the two opposite harmonic 
		directions of flow. This middle energy line is in a balanced state of 
		neutrality. These are the three basic parts of one line&nbsp; that creates 
		with other similar lines to form the earth’s 
		grid. The earth's grid is not one singular geometric design. There are 
		many geometries involved and it all depends on what level you are 
		perceiving. <span lang="en-ca">See <a href="../schematicoftime/researching3.htm">The </a></span><a href="../schematicoftime/researching3.htm">Schematic of <span lang="en-ca">Time and Ancient Sites</span></a><span lang="en-ca"> for </span>more information <span lang="en-ca">on</span> this. </p>
		<p>Although the boulders do align in the direction of some astronomical 
		sources, they are only there to provide <span lang="en-ca">correlation to</span> grander <span lang="en-ca">structure</span>. To 
		demonstrate this, I picked out one of the boulders that would never be in 
		alignment to any astronomical object because it is pointing downhill. 
		The example of this is the standing triangle rock marked in the top 
		diagram as &quot;D&quot;. It is part of the 124 degree line. This line actually 
		goes downhill from the main feature at &quot;G&quot; which is also in alignment 
		with the &quot;Energy Prism Rock&quot;. </p>
		<p>It is all about energy and energy collection. Understanding this 
		energy<span lang="en-ca">,</span> what it is and how it was used will take time to explain<span lang="en-ca"> and understand</span>. One more note for researchers<span lang="en-ca">;</span> <span lang="en-ca">d</span>owsing 
		can also be supplemented with Remote Viewing of the site to extract more 
		knowledge. I have done many RVing sessions with this site and have many 
		experiences to draw from. The most memorable was viewing of a ceremony 
		taking place there in the <span lang="en-ca">distant </span>past. <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">As I watched this group of natives walking in a line behind one another they turned to the right creating a &quot;J&quot; pattern. It was at this point and time that the leader (a shaman) was now facing me. He stopped, than looked in &quot;my direction of view&quot;, then walked forward to my &quot;position&quot; between realities (past and present). At that point he stooped forward and stared right into my face. </span>This startled me so much that the session 
		was over due to my loss of focus. I cannot exaggerate how much fun there 
		is working with tools that allow this type of experience, never mind the 
		information that can be gleamed form it.</p>

		<p class="style70" style="mso-themecolor: text1">Why is dowsing so interesting and important at this time? Dowsing is important because it is one of the few tools that show what is taking place at these sacred sites. Research is showing that the energy that dowsers are picking up is actually harmonics. Below is an article by James W. Lyons.<br><br><b><i>Dowsing: A Gateway to Quantifying Consciousness?</i></b><br><br><i>In much the same way that in, the early days of establishing laws relating gravitational, magnetic and electrostatic forces between objects, the approach taken here is to look at a dowser and a single object, identifying the parameters involved in their conscious interaction. Any field effects involved are considered as a consequence of this basic interaction. Although there are a few people who quite naturally possess the skill of 'feeling' the presence of another object, usually with their hands, others need amplifying detecting devices to make the effect apparent. It is believed that in Neolithic times and indeed with existing primal peoples still living outside our current modern society, the skill is ever present and is certainly used to track animals as but one example of its use. Most dowsers use angle (L-shaped) rods to detect objects, their motion usually indicating the direction of the sought object. Triangulation techniques are used to refine the exact position of the sought object. However, all objects create disturbances in their immediate environment and those affecting the so-called subtle energy field can be sensed by a dowser.” <o:p></o:p></i></p>

The</span><span class="style3" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;"> startling outcome for the researchers in the 1997 geophysical survey of Stanton Drew was in the largest feature of the megalithic complex - the Great Circle (113m in diameter). Magnetometer survey using fluxgate instruments, adapted so that the sensors were carried as close to the ground as possible, revealed that the stone circle was but one element in a much more elaborate arrangement of concentric features. The stones themselves were found to be encircled by a 5-7 m wide henge ditch with an unusually wide (50 m) gap facing to the NE. Within the stone circle were the traces of concentric rings, with a cluster of magnetic anomalies at their center.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

		<p class="style71"><span class="style68" style="line-height: 115%; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-bidi-font-style: italic">James Lyons continues: “The form taken by this disturbance is analogous to a standing wave pattern as observed in a snapshot of ripples on water. A series of rings are detectable whose radii around the object come closer together the further away one goes from the object. In fact, these rings form a geometric series, the ratio of contiguous annular widths generating a constant of 0.891. This figure was eventually discovered to be that associated with a major tone on a musical scale. This basic pattern is found everywhere in nature, including optical diffraction patterns around crystals, energy spirals around carbon atoms in polymers and the shape of the multi- faceted eyes of fireflies, to name but a few. More detailed analysis has shown that the rings are in fact contiguous toroids, located in the free vortex field surrounding the object. The overall shape of the total dowsable pattern is reminiscent of a galaxy disc when seen side on. The whole shape embodies both binary and golden spirals and relates to Platonic solids, in particular 5- &amp; 6- fold geometries. The major result from this investigation so far, is that dowsing, at least for certain aspects related to the non-locality of consciousness, are linked to diatonic scales in music. Further biological evidence for this is that it is believed that the pineal gland in the brain is responsible for the detection of magnetic fields by the human. This gland is surrounded by neurons closely linked with the hearing system, itself of course utilising the binary spiral in its detection of audible sounds.</span><span class="style68" style="line-height: 115%; mso-themecolor: text1"><br><br>In addition to the above work, it has been found that the dowsing of objects which in some sense can be called 'active', results in diffraction patterns similar to 
		the above in shape which expand radially due the energy involved with the object. Certain objects influence the vorticity of the subtle energy field in significant ways, for example - Magneticfields Mechanically stressed quartz Rotating objects such as gyroscopes In the case of magnets, it has also been found that the radius of the first ring around the magnet, i.e its vortex edge increases with increased field strength. Magnetic vector potential is also believed to be detectable by the dowser in addition to the more usual magnetic field. This provides a possible link with non-locality effects observed in Quantum Physics, e.g Bohm - Aharonov effect. Free charge generated by stressed quartz also enhances the size of the detectable vortex field. This could explain the use of standing stones by our Neolithic forefathers which, under geophysical forces, generate changes in field patterns detectable by humans as altered states of consciousness. Thirdly and perhaps the least expected is that rotating objects, somehow mechanically alter the subtle energy field which is also detectable by dowsing. Again, vorticity could be the unifying factor. <br><br>This may have a significant effect on Consciousness research, particularly as we are now beginning to realize that , like all other sensory responses, vibrational patterns are involved. These vibrations are harmonically related, just as Pythagoras always said.”</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

In other sites, 5000 years before that, megalithic shamans were recording the energy patterns on stone (above, to the right Gavrinis, France). These patterns are the energy of the ribbon spiral and more advanced understandings called Patches. <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-ascii-font-family:

If there is any correlation to celestial objects, a distant mountain, or whatever it is simply a coincident in direction. The fact that some celestial objects coincide with different Universal Structures only provides more evidence of this structural pattern. No star or galaxy is in a haphazard position of random chaos.</span><span style="mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-font-family:

		<p class="style71"><span class="style3" lang="EN-CA" style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA;">There are many that would have us believe that the universe is nothing more than an exploded mess of cosmic matter, but nothing could be farther from the truth. Everything has its position, in relevance to all that exists and within the universe’s structural design. Associated celestial objects at primary sacred sites do not have a purpose other than being signposts, a way coordinate to remember the proper angles or conduits of energy. The sun and stars became icons and as thousands of years past the original understandings were rendered down to just the stars and sun as being special. It took many generations to erode this knowledge down to a level where the succeeding groups only retained the special nature of sun and some star’s position. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="style71"><span class="style3" lang="EN-CA" style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA;">At this point in history the sites lost their usefulness to most and took on positions of social gathering places or graveyards for love ones. For the last two thousand years any information gleamed from these sites would have this focus and would have nothing in common with the originators of the site. Today, finding a grave at a sacred site is typically announced as being the purpose for the site, as it is a convenient explanation for a complex purpose. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Along with this, knowing the position of sunrise or a certain stars during the year can determine other desired angles of the universal structure. </span><span style="mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
