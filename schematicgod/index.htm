		<i><b>
		<p><font size="2">Mysticism</font></b><font size="2"> from the Greek (mustikos) 
		&quot;an initiate&quot; meaning &quot;initiation&quot; is the pursuit of achieving communion 
		or identity with, or conscious awareness of, ultimate reality, the 
		divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct experience, intuition, or 
		insight; and the belief that such experience is an important source of 
		knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. - from Wikipedia Dictionary</font></p>

		</font><font face="Arial" size="6">
		<p>N</font><font face="Arial">ow is the time to reveal to the world what 
		countless mystics and shamans have been expressing for tens of thousands 
		of years. The understandings and information have always been there. It 
		was available, and attainable for those who could connect and translate 
		the knowledge. Translators have always been the &quot;media&quot;, the messengers 
		for cultures. They have also been a barrier for succeeding cultures that 
		developed independently from past translators. Messages become lost and 
		confused within new cultures independent interpretations. Every culture 
		past or present has their own interpretation of any single event or 
		piece of information but as the culture dies off so do the icons or 
		symbol* interpretations. The level of consciousness that created the 
		translation shifts and creates its own format. Consciousness is a 
		variable that differs from one human to another. So much that our 
		understandings of each other, our very existence is dependent on a 
		&quot;bridge&quot; of common symbolism that translates from one to another. To 
		understand another human in your own time and culture relies on common 
		beliefs and knowledge. If you replace any of these beliefs or 
		understandings, communication breaks down. </p>
		<p>To be an effective translator, you must have the capacity of merging 
		with the communication first, then without attachment to your own 
		beliefs, create the words that are capable of being understood by the 
		listener. Because of extensive training and exposure from childhood to 
		adulthood, Bill Dayholos has become the perfect modern day translator. 
		With many tools at his disposal and a complete ability to connect to 
		universal knowledge without interference he becomes a clear source for 
		the available knowledge. </p>
		<p>People asking for answers to their own needs, perform the biggest 
		misunderstanding in spiritual or nonphysical searching. These needs are 
		usually off balance or incorrect in the first place. Asking with an 
		imbalance for an answer will usually filter an unbalanced result. A pure 
		translator is one that doesn't look for answers to their own questions. 
		They are not seeking validation of what they know, they are simply 
		asking why. Asking why, rather than is this correct, creates a filter 
		system for the information coming in. People's beliefs and current 
		understandings will always filter pure universal knowledge, translating 
		it into a cultural known or parallel understanding. To connect 
		effectively you must let go completely and in this state of innocence 
		ask to be taught. Your subconscious desideratum will be the steering 
		wheel for the experience. </p>
		<p>Language is a series of symbols that connect concepts to form a 
		common understanding between the speaker and the listener. Changing one 
		symbol or concept that this symbol represents can effectively break down 
		the common understanding between the two. The more change that takes 
		place between the communicator and the listener's symbolic understanding 
		the less is understood in comparison with each other. This can reach a 
		point were communicative language is still taking place but the language 
		of the speaker is interpreted differently by the listener. The words are 
		the same as each understands them, but the message is completely 
		different. This is how easily messages from different nonphysical 
		sources can be muddled and interpreted into a new format. Unfortunately 
		the format will be in the listeners understanding, their representation 
		of the symbols. You can say; <i>&quot;This is what I was told</i>&quot; but can 
		you accurately say this was the message?</p>
		<p>There is only one-way around this impasse and that is to have the 
		translator directly absorb the concepts into their integrated 
		understanding of the information, all this needs to be done before it is 
		put into a language. In other words, one that absorbs the concepts first 
		as a known understanding, then translates them into their language. </p>

		<p><font size="1">* Symbols are objects, characters, figures, sounds or 
		colors used to represent abstract ideas or concepts. A symbol, in its 
		basic sense, is a conventional representation of a concept; i.e., an 
		idea, object, quality, quantity, etc. In more psychological and 
		philosophical terms, all concepts are symbolic in nature, and 
		representations for these concepts are simply token artifacts that are 
		allegorical to (but do not directly codify) a symbolic meaning, or 
		symbolism.</font></p>
