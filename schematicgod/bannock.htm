			<p class="style21"><span class="style8">I</span></font><font SIZE="3"><span class="style8">n the beginning of my journey 
			with these sites, the introduction and information became known as 
			the Bannock Point Understanding. This understanding has since then 
			moved into levels of information and knowledge that surpass the 
			Bannock Point connections themselves. This is the basic introduction 
			that I composed years ago.</span></p>
			</font><font size="4">
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><span class="style8">T</span></font><font SIZE="3"><span class="style8">hroughout the 
			ages, there have been those who have sought to explain the &quot;Great 
			Mysteries of Life&quot; from information they extracted outside this 
			reality. Some used sounds, others used symbols, astronomy, 
			mathematics and even the written word, all in the name of sharing 
			the knowledge. There was one obvious issue, there was no complete 
			unified understanding. These past mystics were not wrong it was just 
			a matter of not being complete with the understandings. They were 
			all worthy attempts to explain the unexplainable, and as such, 
			simply became limited concepts that offer mind-intriguing 
			possibilities for understanding. Humans, if they desire to know the 
			unknowable, will resort to create systems and boxes within which to 
			put those systems, so they can feel secure about knowing the 
			unknowable.</span></p>
			</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="3">
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
			<font SIZE="3">
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="style8">The unknowable is just that - unknowable. You can 
			grasp glimpses of it from time to time. For the complete 
			understanding you will have to exit this reality and human 
			consciousness. Working at the Bannock Point Site, I have been shown 
			understandings far beyond my capacity to explain, and in some cases, 
			there are pieces that I can't fit into any concept that relates to 
			this existence. Without filtering or apologizing the next few pages 
			will be my clumsy attempt to show and explain the gifts that were 
			received. I honestly do not know why I was given this material. 
			Possibly it was as simple as my commitment to share it.</p>
			</font>
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
			<font SIZE="3">
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="style8">If you were to view reality constructs from 
			outside this plane, you would understand there are countless planes 
			within planes. There are untold dimensions and limitless levels of 
			consciousness. And each of these planes are based on the beliefs and 
			thought forms of those who created them. It is like the blind men 
			and the elephant story. Each of these planes are real and correct 
			within that limited context, yet none of them are the big picture. 
			There are for example, planes in which different geometric forms 
			compose the reality construct. The Monroe Institute of Virginia can 
			teach you how to access these focus states or dimensions through the 
			Hemi-Sync program. Those who tap into these planes may try to tell 
			you that this is the basis of the universe. Yet there are also 
			planes in which archetypes are the governing structures. Many 
			shamanic trips or some channelings will provide this level of 
			contact. Those who resonate to these constructs will also tell you 
			that archetypes are really the basis of reality. All are true, and 
			none are true, depending on your chosen context.</p>
			</font>
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
			<font SIZE="3">
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="style8">This is not to say any of these people are wrong. 
			In fact I applaud them for exploring their own divinity and the 
			divinity of all. This is all part of the plan, or as I have been 
			told &quot;the game&quot;. These are evolutionary steps that we are taking to 
			become greater than we are. The trick is not to think that every 
			step is &quot;it&quot; the final solution. The &quot;it&quot; that we have found has 
			always been around in one form or another, and has always been a 
			trap for believing that we have found &quot;it&quot;. Reality is fluid, and 
			the &quot;it&quot; will always change.</p>
			</font>
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
			<font SIZE="3">
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="style8">The ancient shamans/priests did from time to time 
			fall into these traps. One has to recognise that there were those 
			from the past that unravelled enough of the Great Mystery to create 
			what we see now as only relics of the past, modern religions. 
			Generally humans have no patience for something that produces no 
			physical results or involves increasing amounts of labour. Humans 
			are much too pragmatic, and yes there are various &quot;nonworking&quot; 
			religions that have been around for a long time. The truth is that 
			religions can work as tools towards spirituality for many, otherwise 
			they would not be here. Each to his or her own and to their 
			individual level or needs.</p>
			</font>
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
			<font SIZE="3">
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="style8">One of my favourite parts of the Whiteshell 
			Petroforms is that they cannot be subjected to many old &quot;Victorian&quot; 
			concepts of the ancient world. One such theory is that these sites 
			were used to determine the seasons so that crops could be planted on 
			time to be successful. Anyone that would state this is more likely 
			to have been born and raised in the city. Even modern farmers have 
			an understanding of the right time to plant without looking at a 
			calendar. Seasons vary from year to year, some as much as a few 
			weeks apart from one another. Many years ago when I was an avid 
			trout angler, I found this out through need. It all started around 
			the need to be at the trout lakes right after the ice broke up in 
			the spring for the best fishing. There were many wasted trips to the 
			Whiteshell that found us standing on the shore of a frozen lake only 
			to have the ice break up the following week. The answer was to mark 
			the progression of spring. This was done on a calendar for 
			convenience knowing that the dates could not be trusted. Every 
			spring for a few years I would mark on the calendar spring changes 
			and &quot;landmarks&quot;. This could be anything from small creeks and rivers 
			being free of ice to insect hatches and plant germination or buds 
			opening. I don't live in the wilderness like the ancient ones but it 
			didn't take long before I knew what was going to take place next as 
			spring unfolded into summer. This type of knowledge could only be 
			achieved through need and experience. Ancient agrarian and 
			non-agrarian cultures understood this and did not need to develop 
			calendars and astronomical alignments to know when to plant their 
			crops. If you pay attention you will notice that spring and nature 
			follows its own pattern or rhythm. So why develop the need for 
			astronomical progression as far as the seasons are concerned? Why 
			are certain planets or stars chosen as more important than others? 
			Why is there a need for water moats around some of the earthworks? 
			Why are the stones arranged in certain repeated patterns? Why is it 
			that when the stones have been removed there is still a detectable 
			energy at that spot? There are more questions about these sites than 
			actuate answers or understandings.</p>
			</font>
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
			<font SIZE="3" class="style8">
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I don't profess to have all of the answers nor do 
			I believe the &quot;Bannock Point Understanding&quot; covers all of the sites 
			in the world. There are a lot of cultural beliefs that are 
			associated with individual sites and this includes different 
			cultures. I do believe there was a seed understanding that 
			germinated into a workable creation that was powerful enough to be 
			propelled all around the world. After all cultures are colloquial in 
			nature but knowledge is universal. There is much work ahead and will 
			require many people to unravel this mystery. The Bannock Point 
			Understanding was offered as a catalyst to create a new movement, 
			with the teachings of the past.</p>
