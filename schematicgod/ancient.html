		<font FACE="Arial"><font size="6">P</font>etroform sites are rock and 
		boulder arrangements that ancient shamans designed on the ground to 
		serve many purposes. In Manitoba the biggest and oldest site is the Tie 
		Creek area located in the Whiteshell Provincial Park. Here boulders were 
		placed on flat rock out-crops of the Precambrian Shield. Depending on 
		the age and location, the shapes are geometric symbols with human or 
		animal shapes appearing in newer sites. The largest site is the Tie 
		Creek site and is the largest ancient site in North America. This site 
		consists of a 10-acre main area with single element satellite sites in 
		close proximity. The primary Tie Creek site is believed to be 5000-2500 
		years old and consists of geometric symbols. My research on the site 
		dates back to 8000 years with many additions to it as time went on (I will give 
		these dates further on). Thousands of years ago this primary site was 
		hidden for unknown reasons deep into the &quot;back country&quot; away from any 
		trails or canoe routes. Today it is still hidden from the public, but 
		for good reason, that being it’s very vulnerable to destruction. 
		Archeologists believe that the Whiteshell sites in Canada are the start 
		or nucleus of this cultural motif. This is because the Whiteshell area 
		contains most of the elements that the other sites in North America 
		have. The other sites on this continent having only one or more elements 
		while Tie Creek has them all.</font></td>

		simply use our intellect to understand the design or purpose of ancient 
		sites, our findings would lead us to more questions than answers. 
		Shamans and Mystics, the creators of these sites used their abilities to 
		access extended levels of consciousness not intellect for the site’s 
		individual design. </font></p>
		<p>The web is full of theories as to why the ancient sites 
		were built but the difference between this material and all others, is 
		the source of the material. The book, &quot;The Schematic of God&quot; was given 
		to me by nonphysical sources, as universal knowledge. Through my prior 
		training using &quot;Out of Body&quot; and shamanic journeying I have traveled 
		back in time consulting with the past shamans and mystics in a common 
		multidimensional continuum. This is the same 
		source of knowledge the ancients tapped into and it does not come from 
		the intellect. In this reality, life on our planet exists because of its 
		ability to connect to the energy sources that support and allow its 
		creation. With enhanced knowledge the ancients knew how to increase this 
		energy. Their structures were tools that allowed them to become very 
		efficient at creating physical abundance and spiritual awareness. Each 
		site had different purposes at different times but there is a common 
		format in all the designs. </p>
		<p>The instructions were given to me on a step-by-step basis over a 
		seven-year period. I will likewise release it in the format that I had 
		received. The main reason is it takes time to &quot;digest&quot; the knowledge 
		due to the complexity of the design or its schematic. The information 
		was lost in history because of this complexity, they lacked the teaching 
		and record keeping tools that we have today. Pictographs and actual 
		experience became the recorders of this knowledge and this died with the 
		old ones.</p>
		<p>This information has been organized in my book &quot;The Schematic of God&quot; 
		for those who require a deeper understanding of these teachings. 
		Although the information in the book is complete at this level, I am 
		offering additional diagrams and material that expands on the subject.

		<p class="style9"><font size="6">T</font>he sites and their designers are similar in 
		concept with many understandings that have filtered or survived 
		throughout the millenniums. The fragments of this knowledge can be seen 
		in Feng Shui and the East Indian practice of Vastu Vidya, which predates 
		Feng Shui. As I was finishing this book I came across a book on Vastu 
		Vidya and was delighted to see the basics were there in print. Feng Shui 
		and Vastu Vida are proof that this information was there in the past but 
		through time only small pieces survived. In Vastu Vidya they understand 
		there was a grid, that directions are important, and that different 
		energies associated to different directions and placement in the grid 
		were affecting creation. They also recognize the tilt of the earth as 
		having something to do with it all. I know with confidence that 
		thousands of years ago the designers of this philosophy understood much 
		more than has survived today. I also recognize their shortcomings in 
		only seeing the singular plane or slice of the total information 
		package. The grid they describe is two-dimensional and is shown as a 
		flat grid when in fact it should be a cube grid or three-dimensional in 
		construct. Feng Shui, like the practitioners of Vastu Vidya, also 
		recognized that building alignment and angle placements were important. 
		This same importance was given to the ancient sites and their 
		alignments. These alignments are in reference to a nonphysical structure 
		that we also share with the sun and stars. However, the sharing is due 
		to our placement in the overall structure itself and its association is 
		more important than visual alignment. </p>

		<p class="style9">Having the knowledge to connect to the proper elements was not as 
		easy as we think today. Without compasses and charts the ancients would 
		first have needed to find north, and this would give them all the other 
		angles needed. They did this by first hammering a wooden stake (called a 
		gnomon) into the ground (see above diagram). A circle was then drawn 
		around it, using a piece of string twice the length of the height of the 
		gnomon. Where the shadow of the gnomon touches the circle at sunrise and 
		sunset marked the east and west directions. Two large circles were then 
		drawn using these intersecting points as their centers. These were 
		called the &quot;head and the tail of the fish&quot;, indicating true north and 
		south. The intermediate directions were located by drawing four large 
		circles using primary compass points as their centers and where the 
		circles overlap indicated the exact compass points, as in the above 
		diagram.</p>

		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The photo and diagram above shows an ancient 
		Petroform from the Whiteshell, in Manitoba (Bannock Point). The ancient shaman that 
		designed this one was using the prescribed method of finding north and 
		thus his/her desirable 135 degrees. This degree has a very specific use 
		and energy. More will be provided as time goes on, but for now I can say 
		it was to connect to the elemental or slower vibratory levels. The left 
		picture is the actual site element and to the right is a diagram showing 
		the ancient shaman’s method, which is very similar if not exactly as the 
		described methods form the Old-World. </p>

		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How the sites work is extremely complicated and it 
		would take the resources of a very knowledgeable shaman/priest. Once the 
		site was built, all could have benefited from its properties. 
		Unfortunately once the original designer was gone, the site could fall 
		victim to others, unfamiliar with designing or misdirected in purposes, 
		or the site was maintained for different needs being synchronized to the 
		cultural needs of the time. The new mystics that came &quot;on line&quot; would 
		obtain and redesign for their own cultural needs. Thus different 
		spiritual or physical needs would be incorporated into the sites and 
		still keep the original site. </p>

		</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People who study the sites have observed that around 
		the world there are common angular positions or directions that the 
		sites would be aligned to. Also noted was that a group of sites on one 
		side of the planet would be aligned in the same angular direction as a 
		completely different site, on the other side of the globe. Both groups 
		of sites could not be visually seeing the same star or planet 
		configuration regardless of the time of day. How then could this be 
		possibly be related to individual constellations or an astronomical 
		point? It can’t but there is another reason for alignments in common 
		directions. Some of the common directions noted around the world are; 12 
		to19.5 degrees, 52 to 54.5, and 110 to135 degrees. In the Manitoba 
		Whiteshell area, archeologists have for years noticed that the ancient 
		Petroforms (rock mosaics) were aligned at 53.5 degrees. It puzzled them 
		as they scrambled to relate it to something. The sun, moon, and stars 
		had to be the answer, but there was never any valid association found.

		this advanced civilization purposely building on a slant to the other 
		structures on the site. One has only to look at the statistics of the 
		main pyramid at Chichen Itza to see how incredibly accurate the Maya

		of the &quot;leaning stone&quot; or the structure’s tilt (pyramid). It is in these 
		angles that the truth is waiting. There is a great deal of excellent 
		documentation on the web and in books. Unfortunately the most important 
		parts are not noted because of the absence of the unknown pertinacity. 
		The understanding and the purposes are bigger than the ancient sites. It 
		is about life and all that forms this reality with consistency in 
		structure that is a unified understanding of the universe. The angles 
		show the directions to the creative sources. These directions are not 
		about astronomical objects (including the sun) but are to areas that 
		these objects may or may not occupy. The answers are in these areas and 
		are not part of humanity's current knowledge (metaphysical or
