			<p><font size="6">O</font>ne of the misconceptions in spiritually is that enlightenment 
			means the completion of a spiritual journey, the end of a long 
			spiritual &quot;road&quot;. Nothing could be farther from the truth. 
			Enlightenment is but that, enlightened to one current level of 
			understanding. There is no end to the spiritual levels that can be 
			achieved physical or nonphysical. Each layer needs enlightenment to 
			complete the process and move on to the next. Many so-called 
			enlightened individuals have a long way to go to find balance and 
			understanding that exemplifies this reality. The proper term would 
			be <u>Whole Consciousness</u>, meaning a balanced, full spectrum 
			connection to source. </p>
			<p>This material will stand as the beginning of a new conscious 
			expanded form of exploration. This material is not meant to change 
			anyone’s mind. It is not to argue a point, nor is it here to prove 
			itself, for this is almost impossible at this expanded level. It 
			seeks not to create a new religion or to contradict any existing 
			one. In fact it can be used to expand all beliefs and faiths. This 
			material is here as a template, a blueprint of how the universe and 
			spirituality (consciousness) is constructed. New levels of 
			spiritually are revealed for the first time to our modern culture. 
			Both directions of God or &quot;All That Is&quot; are explored. Insights into 
			the most nagging of spiritual questions are revealed. </p>
