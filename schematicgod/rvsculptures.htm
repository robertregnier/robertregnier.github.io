		<p align="left"><font size="6" color="#FFCC66">R</font>emote viewing an individual can be a long process. Sometimes you can 
		get a clear picture of the complete face and other times only a small 
		portion. It can also be a vision of the complete head that only lasts 
		for a second or two. This is very little time when you are trying to 
		replicate this person in clay. You can test this for yourself by viewing 
		a stranger for a two-second period and then trying to draw their face.</p>
		<p align="left">The image of the person that you are seeking also has to go through a 
		clear understanding and permission based introduction. You start by 
		asking to see their image, and from there proceed in explaining the 
		reason for this need. If there is a message that this person wants to 
		give through this projected image of themselves, then the process will 
		have good results. Everyone has their own understanding and needs. This 
		also applies to past historical figures with uncompleted work in the 
		physical reality. The process becomes a symbiotic process of helping one 
		another to achieve each other’s goals. The image of Jesus was a process 
		of at least 15 to 20 different sessions over several months. </p>
		<p align="left">To Remote view a historical figure a well-rehearsed training period 
		in meditation is the greatest asset. You need to be able to drop all 
		expectations and understanding of the individual and blank your mind. 
		Below is a chronological account of the earlier sessions to show how the 
		process can evolve. There was much more information that came through 
		this adventure than is given in this article. </p>
		<b>
		<p align="left">June 11/06</p>
		</b>
		<p align="left">First contact: Saw male body from two sides. Message was very clear 
		to me but not a topic to reveal at this time. </p>
		<p align="left">Message under the vision: Contact was possible with the person at any 
		level that was required to &quot;expose&quot; the truth.</p>
		<b>
		<p align="left">June 13/06</p>
		</b>
		<p align="left">Saw sun weathered forehead with three wrinkles. </p>
		<p align="left">Message under vision: dry outdoor exposure created more advanced skin 
		characteristics. </p>
		<b>
		<p align="left">June 18/06</p>
		</b>
		<p align="left">Did mediation/journey with my partner. Floated around for awhile 
		before settling down. Shortly afterward my energy started to rise – all 
		chakras now opening to their fullest level. Energy continues to rise, 
		entered calm point in a high vibratory state. Focused looking with 
		intent, then as fast as can be imagined right into his face on the right 
		side. A two-second experience, but when I hit his energy and the 
		closeness of the vision I jumped and gasped for air. The power of the 
		energy associated with the vision was very intense and in a very short 
		period. This caused me to gasp out loud, enough that I disturbed 
		partner’s journey. The spatial distance was approximately 12 inches for 
		his face, looking at the right eye orb area. I had a clear view of his 
		eyebrows, a side view of the eyes and top portion of the nose bridge. 
		Vision was to my left upper screen (indicating past). These startling 
		gasps from the energetic contact lasted for many sessions afterwards.
		</p>
		<p align="left">Message under the vision: It only lasted a second but in this first 
		connection with his eyes I was told that I needed to be introduced to 
		energy and be incorporated&quot; into the vibration. It was indicated that it 
		would be one step at a time, this was more a feeling of safety for me 
		due to the violent reaction I had to our differences and his level of 
		energy. </p>
		<p align="left">After this experience I needed time to settle down – not much happed 
		afterward due to my &quot;frazzled&quot; thoughts. My thoughts also kept drifting 
		in concern of how my partner was doing as she had stirred enough from 
		her journey to look at me (it might have sounded like I had a heart 
		attack). During my settling down period I journeyed back towards the 
		last area (dimension). I ended up floating in a purple colored 
		environment for a while then I saw a gold foil like patch appearing to 
		my center-right. It was small and it had a ripped or ragged appearance. 
		I do not know what this meant or was. From there a vision appeared to my 
		lower right, a cylinder shaped object – it appeared to be a scroll case 
		as the forward end of the cylinder had a decorative rim of gold. 
		Following this, to my right, I saw another entity standing. Center and 
		to my vision right, it was a human form, with a very round face. I asked 
		who and what they were and was told it was a guide to help us with this 
		contact process (a bridge). </p>
		<b>
		<p align="left">Second journey in June</p>
		</b>
		<p align="left">Floated again having a hard time settling down. I remembered how 
		familiar his appearance was from some of the artwork I have seen over 
		the years. Was reminded that they too (artists) connected in their own 
		way to the projected image (this was not the first time a connection has 
		happened). At this time I was informed that I needed to absorb and 
		integrate more into the energy to go on. In doing so I was informed that 
		I would be changed forever, but it would be beneficial and create 
		abundance. I agreed but with the realization that I would still need to 
		ask my partner if this was acceptable as it would affect our 
		relationship. </p>
		<p align="left">The truth is when I first entertained the idea of RVing this figure I 
		was hoping that he was plane or unattractive (my nature of wanting to 
		dispel old projections of what &quot;good&quot; is suppose to look like). From my 
		visions of him I found that he was an attractive man. I asked why and if 
		this was correct. I was informed that this is the nature of being in a 
		balanced state of creation. A balanced person will have an attractive 
		nature and less likely to create an imbalanced appearance. It was also 
		important for him in his &quot;Creational design&quot; to be capable of attracting 
		people’s attention so his messages would be heard.</p>
		<p align="left">Floating again I found myself entering into a gray landscape. A dim 
		light then appeared to my right upper quadrant. I approached the light, 
		as it too appeared to get larger. I enter into the light, which 
		increased my speed of travel, to a point the light turned into a tunnel. 
		Streaking down the lighted tunnel like structure I can see markings on 
		the sides but it was too fast to see what they were. I again broke out 
		into a gray expanse with dim suspended but lit objects. They were all in 
		a 3D pattern, in rows as in a grid fashion. I was curious to what they 
		were so I approached one, close enough to realize they were Soul Groups 
		(individual massive groups of souls or soul collectives, explained in my 
		book) associated with the Earth consciousness. </p>
		<b>
		<p align="left">July </p>
		</b>
		<p align="left">I was again shown the three wrinkles in his forehead and a scar on 
		his left temple area. The scar was at a 45-degree angle and about a ¼ 
		inch long, no information on its origin (felt like it was early in 
		life). </p>
		<b>
		<p align="left">Second journey in July </p>
		</b>
		<p align="left">I was shown that a hood was to be expressed. It dipped in the middle 
		at the top and was of a heavier material, with more square outer top 
		corners.</p>
		<p align="left">Message from the vision: it had something to do with people’s 
		perception of hair, its length, and its status in culture. There was not 
		to be any more &quot;fences&quot; put up but rather it was a process of bringing 
		down the &quot;fences&quot; (or old concepts of right from wrong). He was always 
		very careful on what was projected to me knowing which image was to be 
		displayed. He is not impressed with the way things have evolved from his 
		teachings. There is very little of his original teachings that are being 
		exercised or taught by the ones that have the power to do so. For this 
		reason, the future will be different in the way the teachings will be 
		reintroduced. The last message received was that his life’s purpose and 
		design here was to be a teacher. He became one and wants simply to be 
		remembered as that, a teacher.</p>
		<p align="left">There were many short connections that followed until a mosaic of the 
		face was finally created. At times it was only a clear vision of one 
		small part and then at other times I saw the whole head. </p>

		<p>Quick notes taken after journey/RVing for the Buddha image:</p>
		<p>(Each paragraph is a shift in the vision)</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><b>Dec. 23/06</b></p>
		<p align="left">I asked about possibility of interference with the 
		Buddhist religion in my inquiry. I was told there is no chance of that 
		and that there needed to be changes regardless. It was explained to me 
		that the current religion is not what was originally designed (politics 
		and age of religion being the contamination). I was basically asking 
		permission, and these statements confirmed it. At that point I was shown 
		a close view of a rabbit’s left eye - very clear - but I have no idea 
		what it meant.</p>
		<p align="left">Vision shifted to a massive pupil with just a small thin 
		edge of an iris on the outside of my vision. </p>
		<p align="left">Watched many scenes containing a lot of ornamentation in 
		the room and on people – saw back of a man, he had long curly or matted 
		hair tied or pinned up on the back of his head – wavy hair – black</p>
		<p align="left">I then saw the back of man’s left shoulder area, wearing 
		a red robe, quick view of left ear – possible elongated or stretched ear 
		lobe. He felt my presence and turned very slightly to the left without 
		completely turning around. </p>
		<p align="left">Was told that he had body manipulations like tattoos or 
		piercing and that he was &quot;ashamed&quot; of them. He tried to hide them for 
		they dictated a higher-class sect and made it impossible for him to meld 
		into a crowd of the ordinary simple people. He tried to hide this with 
		hair and his robe (uncertain of what stage in his life). This class 
		difference actually worked in his favor but he did not acknowledge this. 
		It was all planned prior to his birth (higher nonphysical levels) and 
		showed the populace more than he accepted about himself (that being of 
		an upper class). To some extent it gave him the &quot;attention&quot; on the 
		&quot;street&quot; that he would not have received in the beginning stages of his 
		sermon if he were just a commoner. </p>
		<p align="left">I then saw a tube or scroll case - ? - cylinder object 
		with one end facing me and the other end extending to my right on a 45 
		degree angle. The closer end had a gold band with ornamentation around 
		it. </p>
		<p align="left">It was at that point I realized I forgot to ask for a 
		specific time period in his life and this was probably why I was getting 
		a mix of different images. In other words the search term was too vague.
		</p>
		<p align="left"><b>Feb. 04/07</b></p>
		<p align="left">I did a small meditation at bedtime directed towards the 
		Buddha. Vision opened up to a medium gray background with an indigo hue. 
		The gray background turned into a stone texture and then a stone face of 
		a man appeared from the surface of the stone. This face then did a 
		&quot;Zoomorphic&quot; transition<b> </b>into a lion’s face. I did not have a clue 
		what this meant at the time. (I found out later in researching this 
		topic that the Buddha is associated with the loin – &quot;a lion among men&quot; 
		and associated with many sculptures of the Buddha is a loin. I found it 
		validating to be presented with something unfamiliar, only to find out 
		later what it means. </p>

		<img border="0" src="images/buddhalion.jpg" width="513" height="181"></p>
		<p align="left">
		&nbsp;</p><font FACE="Arial">
		<p align="left">After this scene faded there was a moment or two and 
		then a clear image of a man appeared. He was in his sixties and of East 
		Indian appearance. Clean shaven - could not see past the face to the 
		hairline. This again was followed by a gray textured stone surface that 
		had several human face parts surfacing, one after the other. In this 
		series there was no complete face, only parts. </p>
		<p align="left"><b>March 18/07</b></p>
		<p align="left">Buddha’s perception of his life was that of living a 
		lie, being of &quot;noble class&quot;. One of his biggest fears and a personal 
		failing was the worry of promoting &quot;bountiful&quot; or abundance. This was an 
		inner clash that was created within him from a prior life of luxuries 
		that he now knows are not needed. The masses and zealous political 
		followers that knew no such personal life of luxury misinterpreted his 
		staunch stand on this. The nonphysical aspect of him would like this 
		issue resolved. During his physical life the environment was very 
		different than now. The nonphysical aspect of him has a need to clarify 
		this and is thus making contact to those that want to listen. </p>
		<p align="left">New image and a clear look at his eyes….. one eye 
		looking at the other … folded towards each other…..(missing a nose to 
		separate them) – message in the symbolism; was to show his self 
		examination. From this image, a human male face started a metamorphism 
		into an ugly creature that diminished in size (still retaining some 
		human qualities). This image faded into water flowing over the bottom 
		steps of a staircase. The view was from higher steps looking 
		downward.….from there the view shifted to a clear pool of water with 
		blue sky reflecting in water (also some small white clouds in the 
		reflection). The Steps symbolized clearing energy …washing, it pooled 
		into a beautiful reflective environment. The steps were revealed as 
		being last step to take, last in process, at the end of the flight of 
		stairs. Saw concerned and serious look from his left eye…. purpose was 
		to show need for correction – re-balancing, spin off process from 
		original teachings. </p>
		<p align="left">I was told that the Buddha explored the physical reality 
		while Jesus explored the nonphysical realities (energy). </p>
		<p align="left">In a channeling conversation both said that respect is 
		the utmost importance. To them respect means; <u>acknowledging or 
		recognizing one’s level, and always in appreciation.</u> </p>
		<p align="left">Respect was and is the key that opens contact to each of 
		these two teachers. Both Buddha and Jesus are drawn to this a main 
		teaching. </p>
		<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Buddha - Respect all life.</p>
		<p>Jesus - Respect all energies. </p>
		<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><b>April 22/07</b></p>
		<p align="left">Clear and in color view of his lips. They were full in 
		an &quot;average&quot; way. The view then shifted to the base of an old tree with 
		many gnarly roots around the ground. There was a slight slope to the 
		ground with small slab stone edged walkway. </p>
		<p align="left"><b>April 28/07</b></p>
		<p align="left">I asked for the Buddha Siddhartha &quot;the lion of men&quot; 
		after his balanced enlightenment. A stone gray bust appeared which was 
		viewed from his left side only. I recognized the individual and this 
		time I clearly saw that he had wavy medium to long hair. I also noted 
		long earlobes from prior adornment (not as long as shown in typical 
		later or modern statues). What were also very noticeable were two large 
		tears on his left cheek. There was a general feeling from the image of 
		sadness???</p>
		<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Feb. 24/08&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Saw triangle area between eyes and the 
		forehead. Also scar/wrinkle in left check only. Receding hair line – 
		combed back at top of head. &nbsp;<span lang="EN-CA">I inquired about the 
		wrinkle and the answer was in the way he slept at night....something to 
		do with the type of surface he slept on and the way his head/face was 
		positioned on it. </span></p>
