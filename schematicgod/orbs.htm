		<p align="center">Winnipeg, Canada</p>
		<p>A friend of mine, Heidi Speidel, gave me some pictures of a flood 
		that had occurred in Winnipeg in 1978. She took these pictures just 
		after a very violent rainstorm as she gathered with her neighbors to 
		look at all of the water left behind. One of the things that she recalls 
		about the time is the &quot;weird feeling&quot; that the atmosphere had to it. As 
		well, her neighbors commented on the unusual feel of the air. The 
		picture below to the left is in a back lane off Nairn Ave. The water is 
		about two feet deep. At the time Heidi thought that these pictures were 
		ruined by the developer, but lately more strange pictures have been 
		showing up in her life. This sparked her interest to look back at these 
		pictures. They are interesting to look at, but when enhanced with a 
		computer, things get more interesting. </p>
		<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/orbw1.jpg" width="200" height="309"><img border="0" src="images/orbwg1.jpg" width="292" height="297"></p>
		<p>In the back lane picture (above to the left) behind the very bright 
		sphere is an unusual sphere that is behind a fence and a vehicle 
		vehicle. You can see in the pictures to the right that the fence/vehicle blocks out or is in 
		front of the the orb object. It also appears to be 
		streaking to the right. You will notice a smaller blue sphere in front 
		of it. If this was something spilled onto the negative you would not get 
		&quot;an object appearing to be behind an object&quot; in the scene.</p>

		<p align="center">August/2001</p>
		<p>Just after my dowsing workshop at Bannock Point, Heidi's photo of a

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><font face="Arial"><font size="6">A</font>t first, it seemed no more 
		than a curious coincidence. Professor Klaus Heinemann, a researcher for 
		NASA, the U.S. space agency, was studying a collection of photographs 
		his wife had taken at a gathering of spiritual healers when he noticed 
		that many of them featured the same pale but clearly defined circle of 
		light, like a miniature moon, hovering above some of the subjects.
		</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Like most rational people, he assumed that the 
		pictures were faulty. &quot;I presumed the circles were due to dust 
		particles, flash anomalies, water particles and so on,&quot; says Prof 
		Heinemann. </font></p>
		<font FACE="Arial">
		<p>&quot;But I was sufficiently intrigued that I returned to the room in 
		which the pictures were taken, in the hope of finding an explanation - 
		like a mirror in the background. None was forthcoming.&quot; </p>
		<p>Nor could he find any faults with his wife's camera. And as a 
		scientist with considerable experience in sophisticated microscope 
		techniques - examining matter down to atomic levels of optical 
		resolution - his methods were nothing if not rigorous. </p>
		<p>Still puzzled, Heinemann set out to discover what else might have 
		caused the mysterious circles. He and his wife began taking hundreds of 
		digital photographs at random events to see whether they could recreate 
		the mysterious effect. </p>
		<p>The answer was that they could make these shimmering 'orbs' appear 
		again, but only - absurd as it may sound - if they 'asked' the 
		apparitions to make themselves visible to the camera. And they found 
		this method worked particularly well when the couple photographed 
		spiritual gatherings. </p>
		<p>What on earth was going on? Again, a maverick technical glitch seemed 
		the obvious answer. Such anomalies happen frequently in digital 
		photography. If you accidentally jog a camera while a picture is being 
		taken, especially in dim light, you can easily get a double image. </p>
		<p>But again, Prof Heinemann ruled out a technical fault. &quot;We were 
		quickly able to eliminate the common problems associated with 
		photography - such as dust particles, water droplets, reflections and a 
		host of other likely causes.&quot; </p>
		<p>Yet the orbs still kept appearing. And the more images he took, the 
		more he was able to study the bizarre properties of these shimmering 
		lights. </p>
		<p>Heinemann set up dozens of experiments using two cameras on static 
		tripods under controlled conditions. His early experiments found that 
		orbs can move very fast, up to 500mph or more. </p>
		<p>Heinemann also found that during his numerous dual camera 
		experiments, when he used twin cameras to capture an object from two 
		different angles, a single orb shape would often appear - but only in 
		one of the two images taken simultaneously. </p>
		<p>It was as if the orbs somehow <i>chose </i>which camera to appear on, 
		or whether to appear at all. </p>
		<p>Eventually, Heinemann was left with only one conclusion: that he was 
		witnessing some form of paranormal intelligence. </p>
		<p>&quot;There is no doubt in my mind that the orbs may well be one of the 
		most significant &quot;outside of this reality&quot; phenomena mankind has ever 
		witnessed,&quot; says Professor Heinemann. </p>
		<p>&quot;Until now, there has been a huge amount of anecdotal evidence that 
		the spirit world exists. I believe it's no longer anecdotal. Thanks to 
		digital technology, we can see it for the first time. We are dealing 
		with a non-physical - albeit real - phenomenon.&quot; </p>
		<p>The temptation, of course, is to dismiss such claims as bunkum. 
		Indeed, many of Professor Heinemann's colleagues consider his research 
		to be 'utter flaky nonsense'. </p>
		<p>And yet a growing number of respectable scientists refuse to write 
		off the possibility that these orbs, which are starting to appear on 
		cameras around the world, just might offer a fascinating glimpse into 
		the unknown. </p>
		<p>Earlier this year, the world's first conference on orbs took place in 
		Sedona, Arizona, where several scientists controversially stated that 
		they believed orbs were indeed a genuine paranormal phenomenon. </p>
		<p>Their conclusions, if correct, could have huge implications on the 
		way we view the universe and our part in it. The experts say that just 
		because something has not yet been scientifically proven, it doesn't 
		mean that it is not real. </p>
		<p>Professor William Tiller, a theoretical physicist who spent 35 years 
		researching consciousness and matter at Stanford University in 
		California, reminded the conference that what we see with our physical 
		eyes comprises less then 10 per cent of the known universe. </p>
		<p>This is because human vision operates only within a limited range of 
		the electromagnetic spectrum. For instance, we cannot see radio waves, 
		which carry huge amounts of information, yet we know they exist. </p>
		<p>Similarly, Miceal Ledwith, a former professor of Theology, who for 
		ten years was President of Maynooth College at the National University 
		of Ireland, reminded the sceptics that when, in 1861, Dr Ignaz 
		Semmelweis had claimed there might be some unseen link between surgeons 
		who didn't wash their hands and the high rate of infection in 
		childbirth, his mainstream colleagues ridiculed him. </p>
		<p>Yet he had found the first evidence of what was later to become known 
		as bacteria. </p>
		<p>&quot;Most great discoveries throughout history have been initially 
		ridiculed,&quot; Ledwith told the orbs conference. &quot;To my mind, there is no 
		doubt that the orb phenomenon is real and deserves to be taken 
		seriously. There are not just a few pictures of orbs, which could easily 
		be faked, but hundreds of thousands from all over the world.&quot; </p>
		<p>To date, Ledwith, who was also a member of the International 
		Theological Commission at the Vatican, has a collection of more than 
		100,000 orb pictures . </p>
		<p>'They come in all sizes, ranging from a few inches to several feet 
		across,' he says. 'Sometimes they appear alone, and at other times 
		hundreds of them, in colours ranging from white to blue, green, rose and 
		even gold. </p>
		<p>&quot;Over time, I realised that a flash seemed to be essential to capture 
		them, even in daylight. I believe this is because we can see the orbs 
		only through the process in physics known as fluorescence. The camera 
		flash sparks this fluorescence process, making the orbs visible to the 
		camera.&quot; </p>
		<p>Ledwith is still uncertain about what these orbs might actually be, 
		but he has no doubt that they are some sort of paranormal apparition.
		</p>
		<p>&quot;I believe they could be many things. They may turn out to be the 
		spirits of those who have passed on; or, as some spiritual teachers 
		state, they might be spirits waiting to be born into a physical body,&quot; 
		says Ledwith. </p>
		<p>&quot;They may also be, or represent, a host of other intelligences - from 
		nature spirits to beings of pure energy that have never been incarnated 
		in a physical form. There are hundreds of different types of orb.&quot; </p>
		<p>Many of the scientists at the conference believe the orbs are 
		plasma-like balls of energy - but an energy that can be detected by 
		physical means, and which appears to have some control over its own 
		shape and form. </p>
		<p>It's certainly the case that they can often be photographed best at 
		places of psychic significance. &quot;They definitely seem drawn to spiritual 
		type gatherings,&quot; says Ledwith. </p>
		<p>&quot;We regularly see orbs near healers' hands or heads. Perhaps they 
		assist in the spiritual healing process.&quot; </p>
		<p>Take the case of Anna Donaldson, a freelance photographer who was 
		commissioned to take pictures of Keith Watson, a medium who had been 
		drafted in to help solve the disappearance of Sarah Payne, the little 
		girl who was snatched while playing near her grandparents' home in West 
		Sussex seven years ago. </p>
		<p>The shoot took place at the exact spot where Sarah was last seen, 
		because the medium had suggested that he &quot;might pick something up&quot;. Sure 
		enough, when the pictures were developed, a mysterious glowing dot 
		appeared in one of the crucial images. </p>
		<p>&quot;I didn't believe in any of this paranormal stuff,&quot; says Anna, &quot;but I 
		couldn't find any fault with the camera - if there had been, then all 
		the images would have been tainted, not just one of them.&quot; </p>
		<p>Still sceptical, Anna had the film and images analysed for technical 
		faults, but again no one could provide a logical answer - until a member 
		of the Psychic Institute suggested that the pictures could indeed be 
		evidence of 'auras'. In this case, Anna was told that the blueish colour 
		of the orb suggested the presence of a very young soul. </p>
		<p>Still intrigued, Anna arranged to photograph Watson again - at the 
		exact spot from where another young child had disappeared, this time in 
		Greece. To her astonishment, the photographs again showed the presence 
		of a blue orb. </p>
		<p>And when Anna repeated the shoot the next day, in a bid to rule out a 
		trick of the light, she got the same result - only this time it was two 
		orange orbs. </p>
		<p>&quot;So what I now had was pictures of orbs from three different cameras, 
		in two different countries, on three different days - there's simply no 
		way that could be a chance occurrence or a technical fault,&quot; says Anna.
		</p>
		<p>&quot;I still don't know what to think about it, but I suppose because a 
		camera can pick up an image at a shutter speed of 1/2,000 of a second, 
		it's possible it can detect things the naked eye cannot see.&quot;</p>
		<p>Could it have been the spirits of the lost children? </p>
		<p>Terri Caldwell, a healer from Belbroughton, in Worcestershire, is 
		among those who are convinced that orbs are a visible manifestation of 
		human spirits. </p>
		<p>&quot;To my mind, the orbs are the spirit world simply going about their 
		business,' she says. 'I believe we are all spirits having a physical 
		experience, and when we die our energy field which carries all the 
		information about us continues on.' </p>
		<p>But not everyone is convinced. Gary Schwartz, Professor of Psychiatry 
		at Arizona University, has conducted many experiments into orbs with the 
		help of optical scientist Katherine Creath and remains sceptical. </p>
		<p>&quot;We feel that a large majority of so-called orb pictures are too 
		readily attributed to some form of paranormal phenomena when, in fact, 
		stray reflections in uncontrolled environments often produce orb-like 
		images,&quot; he says. </p>
		<p>That does not deter those, like Miceal Ledwith, who feel orbs are 
		simply too widespread to be written off as a misunderstanding. &quot;The orbs 
		are an everyday part of reality, as much as we are,&quot; he maintains. 
		&quot;Their world may be as real as ours, but exists on higher frequencies.
		</p>
		<p>'If you change your TV channel, you switch to different frequencies, 
		which contain different information. It's illogical to think that what 
		we cannot see is not real, because the human eye is able to receive only 
		a very narrow part of the light spectrum. Many animals can see in 
		spectrums invisible to us.&quot;</p>
		<p>As Professor Heinemann summarised: &quot;Research into orbs is only in its 
		infancy. But the photographs of these spirit emanations offer evidence - 
		as close to scientific proof as we have ever come - in proving the 
		existence of spiritual reality.&quot; </p>
