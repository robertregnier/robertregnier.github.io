			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">May 27/07</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Inquired about possible work 
			with this individual. Explained my reason for inquiry (mainly the 
			confusion in this time period of her role and status). Also asked 
			for a visual of her for association purposes. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Immediately received clear 
			image of the bridge of her nose and forehead. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">June 10/07</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Saw pink flower with a human 
			eye in the middle. This then shifted to a side profile and a closer 
			view of the eye with the edge of the flower pedals showing. After 
			the journey, I went on line and looked up flowers from her region to 
			see if I could find the one I saw. It appeared somewhat like a rose 
			with less pedals and more curl to the center pedals. Turned out to 
			be Tulipa Agenensis – “Sun’s Eye Tulip”. (possible Ranunculus 
			Millefolius, Nurrit Meturbetet, or Nerium Oleander). It appeared to 
			be an important symbol that represented her. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">July 1/07</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Received very good images of 
			her face and it looked somewhat of a cross between Egyptian and 
			Jewish. Lighter skinned but toned. Small proportioned female nose – 
			very “classical” attractive feminine look. She was projecting an age 
			of being in her mid twenties. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">I asked about the confusion 
			today regarding her role in the biblical creation. I was shown a 
			large limestone cliff face with a square shaped cave entrance. This 
			shifted to the left and another cave entrance came into view. 
			(Possible two similar cave entrances on same cliff wall.) Entered 
			into the second cave and was shown on the left a limestone wall with 
			two cracks in it. There was a slight billow to the stone on each 
			side of the cracks. At first I thought I was being shown a stone 
			symbol of a female lower torso. But it turned out to be an actual 
			stone wall. I was informed that this natural shape became known as 
			the “Woman’s spot”. To the left side of the stone crack was a symbol 
			of an eye carved into the rock. This shifted to one with a flower 
			symbol around it. I am uncertain of what aspect of the symbol 
			remains on the wall or if it was the artist’s intent to create the 
			final image (possibly completed or just a beginning of the carving). 
			The “legs” of the natural crack pointed down to where she buried her 
			documentation of the events. She was the self-proclaimed recorder of 
			the places and events. The other 12 disciples had no interest in 
			this task. She understood the importance and wanted to preserve it.
			</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">July 15/07</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">I saw an Egyptian faced 
			statue and was given the suggestion that she was half Egyptian and 
			half Israelite. There was resentment to this partnership with the 
			Teacher (Jesus) for this woman was seen at the time as not “pure 
			blooded”. Elders of the community started this resentment which 
			contributed more to the already split between different factions of 
			the faith. Jesus did not see their way as everyone was equal and 
			pure in God’s creation. He was at the time, somewhat of a rebel, a 
			“systems buster” in an ideological way. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Feb. 22/08 </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">While doing a journey I was 
			being “tapped on the shoulder” by someone. I allowed the energy to 
			come in and it was Mary. A shadow image of her – beautiful woman 
			with curly hair – (I have seen a similar female face of Jewish 
			decent - this helps me a lot as a sculptor). </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Contact was more of an 
			information package advising me that these images (Remote Viewing) 
			would not be this clear if I did not have some Soul Group connection 
			to the targeted subject. I was shown her nose profile - not known at 
			the time why but found out later it pertains to the connection I 
			have with a person in my present life. I was informed that you need 
			another set of eyes to see these images clearly. Remote Viewing is 
			always possible but the clarity comes from having a common link to a 
			person that was there at the time the subject lived. In this journey 
			I was told that Mary balanced out Jesus’ “yin aspect”. She provided 
			knowledge and energy for his understanding and interpretation of the 
			feminine part of humanity. The other disciples felt this connection 
			and the value it had for Jesus. There was jealousy in the ranks 
			because of this. They all bid for his attention but she always had 
			the most attention on many levels. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Mary Magdalene was a solid, 
			balanced woman of average height for the day. She could be described 
			as average to slimmer in frame. Her last comment was that “her cave 
			is still there waiting to be discovered”. Referring to earlier 
			contact information (June 19<sup>th)</sup>. Final image of the 
			journey - saw her in a white robe with a hood folded onto the back 
			of her shoulders.</font></p>

			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">March 30/08</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">Sunday journey 
			– Saw Mary holding a new born baby in her arms, baby to her right. 
			Mary was wearing a thick grayish colored garment with a hood. Baby 
			was wrapped in a blanket of the same material. I got the impression 
			or feeling that the environment they were in was cold.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">April 6/08</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">I started the 
			journey by seeing just Mary’s left eye from a 45 degree angle. I 
			watched as this eye slowly closed. The eye and the orb area faded 
			out into black. The eye placement was a little off center; to the 
			left and up. Below this eye was a rotating fan shape. The blades 
			were white with hazy edges. Each blade was shaped like a flattened 
			banana with the concave part of the curve rotating into the counter 
			clockwise direction. The hub of the blades (only five blades were 
			visible at a time) was directly under the eye. Impression: that I 
			was seeing another aspect of “time fazing”. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">The scene 
			shifted and I found myself (in and OBE state) “standing” on 
			something and against a rock cliff. As soon as I recognized this I 
			moved out into the limestone ravine ahead of me. I turned to the 
			right and “flew” down the center of this ravine. On the left side of 
			the ravine there was a sharp drop-off while the right was more 
			gradual. I did not understand the significance of what was happening 
			otherwise I would have paid more attention. I recall going around 
			some bends but have no idea how many. I also have no idea of the 
			distance traveled but it did not appear to be very many miles. The 
			ravine opened up to a flat basin with a very large butte sticking 
			out of it. I recognized it immediately as Masada. It was at that 
			moment that I got excited for I knew where I was even if I wasn’t 
			aware of the location of Masada, other than being in Israel. As I 
			“sat” there motionless I asked; <i>“show me the direction to Mary’s 
			cave of records”.</i> Instantly I found myself moving backwards and 
			seconds later I was back to the starting edge of the cliff. It was 
			at this point I could see I was standing at the entrance of a cave. 
			The interesting part of this cave opening is that on the right side 
			the rock juts out in a square shape (see pictures below). The 
			jutting rock was only on the upper half of the right side. </font>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">Second journey 
			that day produced more information on direction. I again found 
			myself “flying” above and approaching the mouth of the ravine were I 
			turned to the right and saw Masada again. Just prior to the end of 
			this flight I saw a square shape on the ground built out of rocks. 
			It stood out clearly against the desert background. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">The next day I 
			started with Google Earth and pieced together what I saw. The 
			pictures below are the most accurate directions to the cave that I 
			can provide at this point. The square shapes are old Roman army 
			camps. The shape I saw was exactly square with two opposite mini 
			walls at the centers. As you can see this symmetrical shape 
			eliminates some of the camps. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">I realize I run 
			the risk of having people digging around the caves in the area but 
			the message was very clear that the documents need to be found. The 
			value is beyond comprehension and I believe someone out there has 
			seen this cave and the symbols in the cave. I do not have the 
			resources to search for this “treasure” myself but someone that is 
			destined to find them will have the means. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
