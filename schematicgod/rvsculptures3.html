		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">A 
		few years ago I tried to find a way of communicating with the sasquatch 
		aspect. I was not that successful past the point of just having 
		visualizations. In these remote viewing sessions I was presented with 
		six or more snapshots of them. One was an older very intelligent looking 
		female and the other individual was a young mature male with jet black 
		hair. I had two views of this male, from its left shoulder as he walked 
		and one in a squatting position at a rock edge off the Tie Creek valley.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		Even after the visions and outdoor experiences it was obvious that my 
		attempt to communicate was not working. So in my next session I went 
		into a higher aspect of them, the soul aspect. I have had years of 
		experiences working with this level on people. In fact I know of a woman 
		who is getting good therapeutic results researching with a psychologist 
		in communicating from this level with disturbed or schizophrenic people. 
		In other words if you can&#39;t ’communicate effectively on this level (the 
		physical) you need to go above this level to a point that is removed 
		from the physical brain and its limitations. On these levels all 
		communication takes place by virtue of “purity of common ground”. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		It was at this point that I started to receive my lessons on 
		communication that far surpassed just communicating with sasquatches. 
		This level asked me to make a statement, and I did
		<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">“What is your method of 
		communicating?”</i></b> After making this statement I was instructed to 
		break it down into feelings. “<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">What”
		</i>I asked?<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">..</i>…The reply was
		<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">“you have to feel curiosity not think it”.</i> </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		The instructions went on; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Start with the first of your words</i> <span style="font-size:14.0pt">“<u>What”</u></span>…..<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">it 
		means you feel curiosity…..so feel this curiosity, do not think it. 
		Start the projection to the other one. It is all about communicating 
		through feelings, just that simple but it’s not that easy…..try it!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		Your second word: <span style="font-size:14.0pt">“<u>your”</u></span>…… 
		(feeling their individuality, through them). </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		<o:p></o:p>
		The third word; <u><span style="font-size:14.0pt">“method</span>”</u>..…(or 
		a way..…feel this by recalling a memory of a moment of accomplishment)
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size:14.0pt">“<span class="style7"><u>communicating”</u></span></span><span class="style7">…..(feel 
		the process of talking and understanding or as hearing someone talk to 
		you). </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		All this has to be felt, if you are a visual person don’t get involved 
		with the visualizations, just feel what you see. This is what the 
		problem has been all this time. They communicate through feelings as a 
		language. We communicate through thought or mind thought. This is also 
		why they are attracted to people that are clear and aware of their own 
		feelings (children and females in general). If you are connected to your 
		own feeling and honor them as such then they understand you and trust 
		you. As soon as you start to think without feelings you lose them and 
		become <u>silent</u> to them. This makes them nervous and untrusting of 
		you. They are attracted to individuals that have feelings and are 
		gentle. Gentle people by nature are ones in touch with their own 
		feelings and are capable of projecting this into life. If you go silent 
		(no feelings) it is perceived as something serious or menacing. Any 
		communication outside of feelings with them is just noise or silence at 
		best. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">I 
		know that there is always an equal exchange of energy in any contact no 
		matter with who or what. This is a universal law of balance and 
		equilibrium in any contract on any level. Knowing this law balance I had 
		to question <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">“what is there in this 
		for the sasquatch aspect?”</i> In other words who is getting what, in 
		this exchange? The answer; For us they are here not to replace our form 
		of communication, but to show us a higher level of communicating with 
		ourselves as well as other life forms. There is an incredible 
		opportunity to advance the human consciousness through this teaching. It 
		is in this new level that other forms of learning and communicating will 
		be born. This system of communication may appear as being very basic but 
		it is a doorway into another evolved form of physical consciousness. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		The first steps are to practice this and do it very slowly so that you 
		are careful not to over look what feelings you are projecting. Feel 
		through it, not think through it, and you will learn. I was told that 
		this is also the way to communicate to whales and their genus. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">I 
		was told that there is a need for some sasquatches to actually seek out 
		individuals that have this ability of communicating. So great is this 
		attraction that they enter areas of danger for them, high populated 
		areas in other words. There is no need to come into these areas for all 
		they need is in the wilderness areas. They are coming into populated 
		areas to make contact. I was also told that as a species they are the 
		most empathic of all physicals including humans.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		Sacred sites like Tie Creek are attractive areas for them because of the 
		“type” of people that are interested in going there, the same goes with 
		parks and areas of beauty. You don’t see too many “Hells Angels” 
		visiting scared site. Sacred sites in themselves create emotional latent 
		energy patterns known as vortexes. This is an attractive secure feeling 
		for a sasquatch. This emotive empathic level of awareness is the reason 
		for their historical survival. Comparing them to cultural humans, they 
		are as compatible as oil as to water. This alone has given them the wide 
		gap that was needed to survive. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		In two of my encounters with them I was presented with offerings of a 
		dead Spruce Grouse. I brought this up in the session as it did not make 
		any sense how an empathic individual could kill so wastefully. I was 
		told that this was the design as it allowed me to feel, the feeling of 
		something so senseless. This was their way of showing me their 
		understanding of what we feel about life itself. They felt from me the 
		deep need to end this existence (that period of my life) and to them 
		that is not compatible with life. They felt that if I could see this 
		useless act that I could feel into myself as well as into them. The 
		purpose was to challenge me. These grouse were not dead but were put 
		into a different state to simulate death. This is a method that pheasant 
		hunter guides know about. They would like to understand from us why 
		there is such a need to kill. This is a challenge to them and something 
		that they want to understand for their growth. Evolution is growth and 
		there is no growth in stagnation. Even if this means a state of 
		uncomfortably, it is still movement and movement is growth. There are 
		benefits for them, but as can be expected at this point time it is all 
		beyond our understanding. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		It is interesting that the last time I was up into the Tie Creek area I 
		had slipped and fell to the wet rock surface under me. It was shortly 
		after this that we noticed a very foul smell that gave away the presents 
		of a sasquatch. We were being watched all along, as my fall peeked the 
		interest of one of these creatures. This was possibly a show of concern 
		or emotional attachment, by it coming in closer. I had not put this 
		together until I read a report on the BFRO site in which a similar 
		experience had happened to a hunter. He had slipped falling to the 
		ground and a sasquatch stood up near him, un-concealing itself showing 
		concern for him. That is until the gun came up ending the encounter with 
		the sasquatch screaming off into the woods. It just goes to show you the 
		level of emotional ability that these creatures have and how empathic 
		they are. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		For these experiences what has worked for me the best is no guns, very 
		few males and small numbers of people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

		After all the reading that I have done on this subject there is one 
		obvious conclusion that can be made. All the pictures (excluding a 
		studio photo) and plaster casts in the world will not prove anything to 
		the academic world. We need a body! No, I cannot shoot one, nor will I 
		support this concept. I have another solution that is not that easily 
		understood. A couple of months ago I asked this question as a thought; 
		what if there is a dead sasquatch up there (Manitoba Whiteshell) in any 
		condition? Going into a Remote Viewing session I asked the question and 
		saw a crude &quot;nest&quot; structure of branches and small trees. Inside this 
		structure was a mat of scraggly fur. As I looked at this mass I saw on 
		the top of the fur pile a white bone sticking out. This was a clear 
		vision and I was looking at a femur, the Greater Trochanter part (knee). 
		It appeared to be a mostly decomposed body, just hair and bones. For a 
		couple of months prior to that I have been drawn in my Remote Viewing to 
		this small ravine that enters into Tie Creek Valley. This is just 
		northeast of the Tie Creek Site. I have not been able to enter this area 
		with my RVing as if I was being blocked somehow. This made me even more 
		curious, but I did want to be respectful (there is also a native burial 
		ground near by) so I left it alone. Sometime after this blockage I was 
		still on the search and then it happened, I was allowed to enter. This 
		time I was there and it &quot;felt&quot; like I was in this burial spot, at the 
		junction of the two rock depressions. With the veil being lifted I have 
		gone back and seen a top crown of another skull mixed into the floor of 
		the bush and leaves, obviously much older in time duration, with no 
		surrounding &quot;nest&quot; structure. This might indicate a “grave yard” area of 
		some kind.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="color: silver; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		I have continued to Remote View the older one and have found out that it 
		is female. On two occasions I have R. Viewed and found her sleeping or 
		what felt like a semi hibernation. I say this because the last time 
		(Feb. 15<sup>th</sup>/05 7:00 PM it was -20 Celsius outside) she was 
		what appeared to be in some like of enclosure like a cave with two or 
		three more individuals very closely packed together.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		It is my own theory but I do believe that there are sub species of the 
		creature across North American. This conclusion is based on my 
		experience and the reports that I read from across the continent. I feel 
		that the ones in the Whiteshell are more inquisitive and gentler than 
		the typical western ones. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">I 
		totally believe that there are numerous variants in the population, 
		regional difference levels, and sub species levels. Form what I have 
		seen there are differences that vary greatly, like human appearance 
		does.<o:p></o:p></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		As per your question about the Sasquatch community of the Alaskan 
		coastal area we set up a journey together (my partner and I). It was 
		very different in many ways than I’m use to seeing here in the Manitoba 
		population. This group or community in your area is not interested in 
		any human contact even from a distance. The one that I have experienced 
		on the physical level here is very curious and has a need to learn. The 
		ones up in your area (cannot say that for other areas south or east of 
		you) appear to have a very introvert stance and are more than ready to 
		defend this state. I had seven images come to me the first appeared to 
		be a very large male who’s energy was overwhelming at first contact. 
		This individual is projecting a strong dominant posture of defiance to 
		all creatures that are not one with them. He feels so strong that I 
		doubt if any grizzly in the area would take him up on his position. The 
		scene shifted to a close up of a left eye form the side. From there I 
		saw an older one from straight on at a distance (approx. 20 feet) the 
		details were not that good. In the seven images, there were at least 
		three individuals and two scenes sticking out as the most interesting 
		and informative. The first was; watching one Sasquatch standing and 
		(with two hands flat open) was eating or licking an object. Its elbows 
		were bent with hands spread wide open holding what looked like a flat 
		piece of bark. The bark appeared to be performing the same function as a 
		dinner plate. I’m not suggesting that they use plates to eat. In its 
		appearance, there was something good to eat that just happened to be on 
		a piece of bark approx. 12 to 14 inches wide. It was half bent forward 
		to do this and was licking at the material on the surface of the bark 
		(more on this subject later). The last image blew my mind and answered 
		many questions I have had over the description of these creatures. I was 
		shown a close-up (if you were looking 10&quot; away) of one of their noses. 
		TOTALLY different than the ones I have seen in this area. It was almost 
		identical in colour to a cow’s nose with it going into a darker shade 
		towards the septum (the center part of the nose). There was one feature 
		that was different and that was a fleshy ridge outlining the nose. This 
		was in the form of a ridge that was of equal height to most of the other 
		aspects of the nose. It is not like me to say this but, its appearance 
		was nothing short of ugly. Then as I was looking at the ridge aspect, it 
		moved and that was a big surprise. It did not move much but it was 
		articulated in performance. This will go a long way in explaining the 
		differences people see. I do believe that the facial structure I saw was 
		too different for one species. Maybe it’s a subspecies or a very radical 
		hereditary offshoot??? </p>

		Now for the interpretation of it all from my partner’s insight: </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		<em>This is very important to understand and heed. They (the ones in 
		your area) do not want to have any contact and prefer to be left alone. 
		This is not saying you cannot have an experience but it is saying to use 
		caution if you expect anything to happen. They will have to be 
		approached on their terms only. There is not concession or variance to 
		this. My partner gave me a clear understanding of their ways and how to 
		approach this. Most of this work will have to come from inside your mind 
		(believe it or not). You will have to state a very clear intention to 
		yourself and them (as a projection); what is your purpose and intention 
		for this experience. </em></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		<em>&nbsp;</em></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		<em>Things to do:</em></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		<em>Make an offering in the form of food. Food is symbolically a 
		universal nurturing/caring way of showing interest. Nuts or apples are 
		recommended. With the nuts some are to be opened to show content and 
		some are to be left whole. The offering must be repeated over a couple 
		of attempts or more. The most important thing to do is to clear your 
		mind (if you meditate as a practice this will be easy for you). You must 
		not and cannot in your mind expect anything from them by this action. 
		They will pick up your intent and it will drive them away more than 
		attract them. They will not compromise even if you are in a giving way. 
		In fact they will probably ignore the offering as a message symbol to 
		you. Clear your mind on the drive there. Project out what your intent 
		is; to show interest but with total distance and respect. Keep your mind 
		clear of thoughts like; “Will they accept this, will they show 
		themselves, will they hurt me, will they ignore this, will they”……. No 
		judgment is so important if this is to work. Make the offering and leave 
		the area, but project out to them that you will return so they are clear 
		on your intent.</em></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		<em>&nbsp;</em></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		<em>The following day or so, go back using the same sequence (do not do 
		or add anything or anyone different) and check the offering. If it is 
		gone, add to it and leave with the same thought of not expecting 
		anything from them. If you bring a friend with you and are confident 
		that they can support this method that is fine. If they can’t support 
		this level, allow them to come to a certain distance and with you in 
		sight of them continue on to the offering spot (if possible at a good 
		distance). Project out to them that you will return so no 
		misunderstandings are given. </em></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		<em>&nbsp;</em></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		<em>This gift of food should be placed on a natural material like a 
		large leaf or slab of bark (try not handling it too much). This is where 
		my standing/licking vision came in, I think the vision I saw could 
		possibly be from your future work with them (no guarantees of this).
		</em></p>

		(He asked were to start.) </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		As far as what area, I do have two suggestions. In the beginning of this 
		journey I asked where? In writing this, I got the message that it could 
		take place at your vehicle parking spot for the food offering. I also 
		felt it should be on a shore line or beach area. The reason being that 
		the Sasquatches need the security of knowing where you are (watching 
		your approach and departure) for there is security and they have all the 
		woods behind them. </p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p>While exploring European and Asian early human types I was 
		introduced to an explanation of what sasquatches are. They started the 
		lesson with some information on different early human races that lived 
		60,000 to 40,000 years ago and from there I was shown how our perception 
		of evolution is only one perspective. We see a lineal line of 
		progressively superior humans, starting out from a brutish simple type, 
		progressing in time towards a less hairy and the more intelligent 
		current form of today. This is not how it works, but staying on the 
		topic it is a perception and one that constitutes the evolving from 
		animalism to dominating intellect.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		From this point I was shown that some humanoid species chose different 
		lines or directions in their evolution to “source”. After a development 
		stage and the realization of their desires they picked a path that is 
		different and in the opposite flow to modern human races. The early 
		Sasquatch’s need to explore nature’s balance drew them into a new 
		species that demanded more physical strength or animal type forms. The 
		Sasquatch is thus a <span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language:EN">hominid</span> 
		that is evolving towards what we would see as an animal form. In other 
		words they are evolving into denser vibratory levels or the opposite 
		direction that we are. This is a conscious decision that takes place in 
		a parallel reality of space and time to us. In fact they could be placed 
		into a different reality as far as that goes, and one that will 
		eventually disappear from our ability to perceive. This is the reason 
		why some experiences are so surreal and during contact have the feeling 
		of detachment from our own reality. The experiences are thus ones where 
		time and space allows the two realities to find a common stage. Vortex 
		areas facilitate this alignment more efficiently than “normal” 
		landscapes. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><o:p>
		&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="color: silver; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;">
		Their ancestors used stone tools more than they currently have need for. 
		Essentially they are evolving away from tools and the reliance on them. 
		As the human vibration increases we too will eventually evolve out of 
		the reliance for tools in the physical. Through higher vibrational 
		flows, this takes human evolution into an opposite direction for its 
		source. This process will probably take a couple thousand years to 
		achieve. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>

		Your sculpture looks more like early man, maybe these are some type of 
		humans who never evolved. My wife and I saw one up close in Chesterfield 
		County, Virginia in January, 1976. Its body was massive and it stood at 
		least seven feet tall – bent over. My wife and I were sitting in our 
		brand new 1976 Ford pick-up and it was touching the front hood of the 
		truck. It was dark but I had just placed the high-beans on after sliding 
		to a squealing stop. My wife saw the creature first and let out a blood 
		curdling scream; had she not screamed – I might have hit it. In fact, I 
		did not see it until it stepped in front of the right headlamp, and at 
		that point my jaw dropped and perspiration began to bead up on my 
		forehead and neck. We sat quietly for over a minute just watching “the 
		beast” stand there motionless in front of us. The hair on the creature’s 
		left arm and chest glistened as if its exterior were coated in glass. 
		Finally, I asked XXXX, “What is that?!” Her immediate response was. 
		“It’s a gorilla!” My reply was. “What’s a gorilla doing out here?” Nancy 
		did not answer for a while because the creature had taken one step and 
		was standing at the front center of the hood. At this point I noticed 
		the hairy animal was holding its head down as though it were embarrassed 
		or shy. Also, I noticed that its head was shaped more like a human’s 
		than a gorilla’s. Looking at your sculpture, I would say it was very 
		close to the head we saw, but its nose was not as pronounced as you have 
		depicted it. I only got one chance to see its face straight-on and that 
		was after it left the front of the truck and began to climb a small hill 
		just to the front and left-hand side of the truck. Its face was longer 
		than what you have sculptured and the eyes were not set back as far into 
		its head. There seemed to be no hair from its forehead to its chin. Two 
		things I noticed more than anything were its huge muscles under its hair 
		and its extremely long arms. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		When it began to climb the hill, it slipped but caught itself with its 
		right fist. XXXX and I sat there in our truck shocked by what we had 
		seen. She wanted to report the sighting to the police but I argued 
		against it. We waited over 10 years before telling family members. Until 
		we began to see television shows about Bigfoot sightings, we thought we 
		had seen some kind of deformed gorilla. This happened near a small creek 
		and some people in the deep South (people in Mississippi and Alabama) 
		refer to them as creek monsters.. I never hunted in that area after that 
		night. Thought you might want to know one family’s experience with this 
		huge hairy creature.</p>

		In the spring of 2004 I took a group of people up to the Tie Creek area. 
		Standing at the edge of a valley, I said to the group do you want me to 
		try calling in a Sasquatch? I had read years ago that knocking on wood 
		could produce an equal answer–response from a Sasquatch, if there was 
		one in the area. They agreed so I picked up a large branch and struck it 
		three times against a dried Jack Pine tree that was lying on the bed 
		rock of the valley’s edge. After two series of three blows and no 
		response from the valley below we started to leave the area. About four 
		hundred yards into our trail (the one we just came down on) I came 
		across my second incident of a dead grouse on a trail. It was like the 
		first one a year earlier with its wings tucked in and laying straight, 
		placed in the middle of our original trail that we just took to the 
		valley’s edge. There was no noticeable rigor mortise so I reached down 
		and stuck a finger under the wing into the breast feathers, it was still 
		slightly warm. It was spring and still cool weather, enough to bring the 
		temperature of this small body to atmospheric level within a half-hour, 
		so I concluded that it had just been laid there. We finished this trip 
		without any other incident. </p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
		returned to the valley edge again two and half months later on August 20<sup>th</sup> 
		to find that this dried pine tree was smashed to pieces. A bear is the 
		only thing that would do this looking for grubs and insects. The problem 
		is this tree is very dry and laying on a rock mantel not a place that 
		would be conducive for insects to be interested in. Insects find homes 
		in moist wood and humus or leaf mulch beds. Bear’s are lazy and will not 
		make the effort unless they smell food. There was no reason for a bear 
		to smash up this tree and twist off the branches. The main broken branch 
		is a fork of this tree and was three feet off the rock with a diameter 
		at the base of five inches. The branch was twisted around and snapped 
		like a toothpick. This is would take an articulated hand to accomplish, 
		not that of a bear. It would also take an incredible amount of strength. 
		I realized at the time that this smashed tree was a calling card of some
