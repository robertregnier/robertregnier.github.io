		<p>5.1 PK Phenomenon</p>
		</b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">
		<p>P-Teleportation is a form of psychokinesis (or PK) similar to 
		telekinesis but generally used to designate the movement of objects (called apports) through other 
		physical objects or over great distances. Telekinesis is a form of PK, 
		which describes the movement of stationary objects without the use of 
		any known physical force. And PK is essentially the direct influence of 
		mind on matter without any known intermediate physical energy or 
		instrumentation. Rigorously controlled modern scientific laboratory PK, 
		and related psychic (a.k.a. &quot;psi&quot;, &quot;paranormal&quot; or parapsychology), 
		research has been performed and/or documented by Rhine (1970), Schmidt 
		(1974), Mitchell (1974a, b, see also the references cited therein), 
		Swann (1974), Puthoff and Targ (1974, 1975), Hasted et al. (1975), Targ 
		and Puthoff (1977), Nash (1978, see also the references cited therein), 
		Shigemi et al. (1978), Hasted (1979), Houck (1984a), Wolman et al. 
		(1986, see also the references cited therein), Schmidt (1987), Alexander 
		et al. (1990), Giroldini (1991), Gissurarson (1992), Radin (1997, see 
		also the references cited therein), Tart et al. (2002), Shoup (2002), 
		and Alexander (2003).</p>
		<p>A well-known theoretical/experimental/operational program directed by 
		H. E. Puthoff, R. Targ, E. May and I. Swann was conducted at SRI 
		International and the NSA, and sponsored at various times by the Central 
		Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and 
		the Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) over more than two 
		decades; and the program was later carried on by E. May at SAIC 
		(Alexander, 1980; Puthoff, 1996; Targ, 1996; Schnabel, 1997; Tart et 
		al., 2002). This was called the Remote Viewing program, and it was a 
		compartmentalized special access program possessing a variety of 
		codenames during its 22 years of operation. Remote viewing involves 
		precognition and clairvoyance, and it allows a practitioner to acquire 
		information irrespective of intervening distance or time. The Remote 
		Viewing program ended in 1994 and President W. J. Clinton officially 
		declassified it in 1995. The reader should note that the very first U. 
		S. military-intelligence R&amp;D programs on psi, PK and mind control were 
		conducted by H. K. (Andrija) Puharich, M.D., L.L.D during his military 
		service at the Army Chemical and Biological Warfare Center at Fort 
		Detrick, Maryland in the 1940s-50s. Puharich had an interest in 
		clairvoyance and PK, and dabbled in theories for electronically and 
		harmaceutically enhancing and synthesizing psychic abilities. While in 
		the Army, Puharich took part in a variety of parapsychology experiments, 
		and he lectured Army, Air Force and Navy groups on possibilities for 
		mind warfare. He was a recognized expert in hypnotism and 
		microelectronics. PK phenomenon was also explored in the Remote Viewing 
		program. Col. J. B. Alexander (USA ret.) credits professional aerospace 
		engineer Jack Houck for &quot;capturing PK phenomenon and transitioning it 
		into an observable form&quot; (Houck, 1982, 1984a, b; Alexander et al., 1990; 
		Alexander, 2003). During the past three decades, Houck (along with 
		Alexander) held a number of PK sessions, whereby attendees are taught 
		the PK induction process, and initiate their own PK events using various 
		metal specimens (forks, spoons, etc.). Individuals were able to 
		completely bend or contort their metal specimens with no physical force 
		being applied whatsoever. Numerous government science advisors and 
		senior military officials took part in and/or witnessed these events, which took place at the 
		Pentagon, at officers’ or scientists’ homes, and at one quarterly INSCOM 
		retreat attended by the commanding general and a group of colonels and 
		generals commanding INSCOM units around the globe. Spontaneous 
		deformation of the metal specimens was observed at the PK session 
		conducted during the INSCOM retreat, causing a great deal of excitement 
		among those present. Other notable trained observers were also present 
		at this session, and they critically reviewed the events. Psychic Uri 
		Geller (1975) is the original model for demonstrating</p>
		</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
		<p>Pg. 56</p>
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">
		<p>PK metal bending. During a talk that he gave at the U.S. Capitol 
		building, Uri caused a spoon to curve upward with no force applied, and 
		then the spoon continued to bend after he put it back down and continued 
		with his talk (Alexander, 1996). Jack Houck continues doing extensive 
		experimental work and data collection on micro- and macro-PK phenomena. 
		Scientifically controlled PK experiments at the Princeton University 
		Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory were conducted by Robert Jahn 
		(Dean Emeritus of the School of Engineering), who reported that 
		repeatedly consistent results in mentally affecting material substances 
		has been demonstrated in the lab (Jahn and Dunne, 1987). In the 1980s, 
		Jahn attended a meeting on the PK topic at the Naval Research 
		Laboratory, and warned that foreign adversaries could exploit micro- or 
		macro-PK to induce U.S. military fighter pilots to lose control of their 
		aircraft and crash.</p>
		<p>Very early investigations of, and experiments on, p-Teleportation 
		occurred during the 19</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="1">th
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">and early 20</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="1">th
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">centuries. Many cases that 
		were studied, and the experiments that were performed, were undoubtedly 
		due to fraud, and few experiments have occurred under controlled 
		conditions during that period. However, most of the credible, scientific 
		reports of p-Teleportation phenomenon and related (controlled) 
		experiments occurred in the late 20</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="1">th
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">century (see for example, 
		Alexander et al., 1990; Radin, 1997). Some of that scientific work 
		involved the investigation of Uri Geller and a variety of other 
		recurrent spontaneous PK phenomena (Hasted et al., 1975; Puthoff and 
		Targ, 1975; Targ and Puthoff, 1977; Nash, 1978; Wolman et al., 1986). 
		Psychics Uri Geller (1975) and Ray Stanford (1974) claimed to have been 
		teleported on several occasions. Most claimed instances of human 
		teleportation of the body from one place to another have been 
		unwitnessed. There are also a small number of credible reports of 
		individuals who reported being teleported to/from UFOs during a UFO 
		close encounter, which were scientifically investigated (Vallee, 1988, 
		1990, 1997). But there are a larger number of such reports that are 
		anecdotal, whereby the witness data tends to be unreliable. However, we 
		will confine our discussion to the controlled laboratory experiments 
		that have been performed and reported. One of the more interesting 
		examples of controlled experiments with Uri Geller was one in which he 
		was able to cause a part of a vanadium carbide crystal to vanish (Hasted 
		et al., 1975). The crystal was encapsulated so it could not be touched, 
		and it was placed in such a way that it could not be switched with another crystal by sleight of hand. A more spectacular series of 
		rigorously controlled (and repeatable!) laboratory experiments occurred 
		in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). In September 1981, an 
		extraordinary paper was published in the PRC in the journal Ziran Zazhi 
		(transl.: Nature Journal), and this paper was entitled, &quot;Some 
		Experiments on the Transfer of Objects Performed by Unusual Abilities of 
		the Human Body&quot; (Shuhuang et al., 1981). The paper reported that gifted 
		children were able to cause the apparent teleportation of small objects 
		(radio micro-transmitters, photosensitive paper, mechanical watches, 
		horseflies, other insects, etc.) from one location to another (that was 
		meters away) without them ever touching the objects beforehand. The 
		experiments were operated under exceptionally well controlled conditions 
		(both blind and double-blind). The researchers involved included not 
		only observers from various PRC colleges and medical research 
		institutes, but also representatives from the PRC National Defense Science Commission. Because of the involvement 
		of the latter, it was deemed necessary that an unclassified Intelligence 
		Information Report be prepared by the DIA (see Shuhuang et al., 1981), 
		which included a detailed English translation of the article.</p>
		<p>Additional research carried out by the Aerospace Medicine Engineering 
		Institute in Beijing was reported in the July 1990 issue of the Chinese Journal of Somatic 
		Science (Kongzhi et al., 1990; Jinggen et al., 1990; Banghui, 1990), 
		which was also translated into English by the DIA. Reported in several 
		articles are experiments involving the videotaping and high-speed 
		photography of the transfer of test specimens (nuts, bundles of matches, 
		pills, nails, thread, photosensitive paper, chemically treated paper, 
		sponges dipped in FeCl</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="1">3</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">, 
		etc.) through the walls of sealed paper envelopes, double layered KCNS 
		type paper bags, sealed glass bottles and tubes with sealed caps, and 
		sealed plastic film canisters without the walls of any of these 
		containers being breached. All of the Chinese experiments reported using 
		gifted children and young adults, who possessed well-known extraordinary 
		PK ability, to cause the teleportation of the various test specimens. In 
		all the experimental cases that were reported, the test specimens that 
		were teleported were completely unaltered or unchanged from their 
		initial state, even the insects were</p>

		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">
		<p>unaffected by being teleported. The experiments were well controlled, 
		scientifically recorded, and the experimental results were always 
		repeatable. The Chinese papers are all extremely interesting and very 
		well written, and they show photographs and schematic diagrams of the 
		various experimental setups. The experimental protocols were explained 
		in lengthy detail, and thorough data and statistical analysis were 
		presented in the results. The combined results from the several Chinese 
		experiments showed that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>different research groups designed different experimental 
			protocols, used different gifted psychics, used different sealed 
			containers, and used different test specimens (live insects, bulk 
			inanimate objects, and even radio micro-transmitters were used to 
			track the location of the specimens) that were to be teleported;</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>the time required for the teleportation of test specimens 
			through various barriers was anywhere from a fraction of a second to 
			several minutes, and this was not dependent on the test specimen 
			that was used, the sealed container that was used (or its barrier 
			thickness), which experimental protocol was used, or which psychic 
			was being used</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>the high-speed photography/videotaping recorded in one series of 
			experiments that test specimens would physically &quot;meld&quot; or blend 
			with the walls of sealed containers; and recorded in a different 
			series of experiments that test specimens would simply disappear 
			from inside the container only to reappear at another location 
			(after seconds to several minutes of time transpired), such that the 
			test specimen did not actually undergo total material 
			disintegration/reintegration during teleportation – this data is 
			important, because without the aid of electronic monitoring 
			instruments, the average person’s sensory organs and usual methods 
			of detection are temporarily unable to perceive the test specimen’s 
			(ambiguous) existence during the teleportation process;</li>
		</ul>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the radio micro-transmitter used as a test specimen in one 
			series of experiments (Shuhuang et al., 1981) transmitted a radio 
			signal to several stationary electronic instruments/receivers, so 
			that the specimen could be tracked and monitored (via signal 
			amplitude and frequency measurements) during the teleportation 
			process; the experimenters discovered that there was large 
			fluctuations in the intensity (in both amplitude and frequency) of 
			the monitored signal to the effect that it would either completely 
			disappear or become extremely weak (to the extent that the 
			monitoring instruments could scarcely detect it) – it was discovered 
			that there was a definite correlation between the change in strength 
			(i.e., radical frequency shifts were observed) of the monitored 
			radio signal and the teleportation of the test specimen, such that 
			the weak or absent signal indicated that the specimen was 
			&quot;nonexistent&quot; (or in an altered physical state) during teleportation 
			(note: the monitored signal amplitude and frequency of the 
			micro-transmitter specimen were stable before and after 
			teleportation);</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>before and after &quot;passing through the container wall/barrier&quot;, 
			the test specimen and the container’s wall/barrier are both complete 
			solid objects;</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>the gifted psychics were never allowed to see (they were 
			blindfolded in many experiments) or touch each of the test specimens 
			or the sealed containers before and after experiments were 
			conducted, and only the experimenters touched the specimens and 
			containers (using both blind and double-blind protocols);</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>the experimental results were all repeatable and the conditions for fraud and sleight of hand were totally eliminated, 
		and multiple independent outside witnesses (technical and 
			military-intelligence experts) were present at all times to ensure total fidelity of the experiments. The experimental radio micro-transmitter and high-speed 
		photography/videotaping data offer an important clue on what the teleportation mechanism is, and this will 
		be discussed further in Section 5.1.1.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The Chinese were unable to offer any significant physics hypothesis 
		that could explain their results. Some researchers stated that it is 
		necessary to invoke a new physics, which somehow unifies the human 
		consciousness (i.e., physics of consciousness) with quantum and 
		spacetime physics, in order to understand p-Teleportation and related PK 
		phenomena. The researchers were amazed by their repeated results, and 
		were barely able to fathom the altered &quot;state of being&quot; that test 
		specimens underwent during teleportation.</p>
		<p>It is also important to point out that during the Cold War the DIA 
		produced three (now declassified) reports on the parapsychology research 
		of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pack allies (LaMothe, 1972; Maire and 
		LaMothe, 1975; DIA Report, 1978; other related studies were reported by 
		Groller, 1986, 1987). The purpose of the reports was to collate and 
		summarize collected intelligence, describe in great detail, and assess 
		the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact R&amp;D on parapsychology and paraphysics. 
		The reports outlined the history of pre-revolutionary (Czarist) Russian, 
		and WWII and post-WWII era Soviet R&amp;D on psychotronics, human 
		mind/behavior control, and the entire spectrum of parapsychology. The 
		Soviet information also mentions the psychotronic/parapsychology R&amp;D 
		materials that Soviet military forces took from various Nazi research 
		centers in and around Germany at the end of WWII. The entire spectrum of 
		parapsychology phenomena was explored by the Soviets, which resulted in 
		the generation of a wealth of experimental data and related scientific research 
		literature. One DIA report noted that there was an East versus West 
		science debate in the Soviet literature over whether paranormal 
		phenomenon and related experimental data was real or even scientifically 
		sound in comparison to western scientific practice and philosophy. 
		Another DIA report lists the names and affiliations of all the 
		researchers, as well as the names of the various Soviet and Warsaw Pact 
		research centers, that were involved. Also, Pratt (1986) reviews and 
		summarizes the history of Soviet psychotronics research. The U.S. 
		military-intelligence establishment was concerned with the possibility 
		that the Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies were conducting 
		psychotronics and mind control R&amp;D in order to discover how to exploit 
		and control powerful phenomena that could be used against the U.S. and 
		its allies. LaMothe (1972) chronicled how the Soviets had been 
		researching methods of influencing human behavior for over sixty years. 
		The Soviets and their allies extensively explored an influence 
		technology that they called &quot;controlled offensive behavior&quot;, which is 
		defined as &quot;research on human vulnerability as it applies to methods of 
		influencing or altering human behavior&quot; (LaMothe, 1972). Also, LaMothe 
		(1972) describes the revolutionary techniques the Soviets studied to influence human 
		behavior, which included: sound, light, color, odors, sensory 
		deprivation, sleep, electromagnetic fields, biochemicals, 
		autosuggestion, hypnosis, and parapsychology phenomena (such as 
		psychokinesis, telekinesis, extrasensory perception- ESP, astral 
		projection, clairvoyance, precognition, and dream state, etc.). The 
		LaMothe (1972) report became an aid in the development of 
		countermeasures for the protection of U.S. and/or allied personnel. 
		Psychotronics is the general term that was used in the former Soviet 
		Union/Warsaw Pact countries to categorize many psychic phenomena 
		undergoing scientific research. The conclusions that were reached in the 
		DIA reports are that within the category of psychotronics, the Soviets 
		identified two discrete skills (LaMothe, 1972):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>bioenergetics: those phenomena associated with the production of 
			objectively detectable effects such as psychokinesis, telekinesis, 
			levitation effects, transformations of energy, i.e. the altering or 
			affecting of matter</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>bioinformation: those phenomena associated with the obtaining of 
			information through means</li>
		</ul>
		<p>other than the normal senclairvoyance, i.e., using the mind to tap 
		into the thoughts of others or to acquire present or future information 
		about objective events in the world These phenomena involve using the 
		mind and/or some &quot;field&quot; of the body to affect other minds and inanimate 
		objects irrespective of intervening distance or elapsed time, and 
		without engaging any conventional tools. Bioenergetics and 
		bioinformation are two classifications that form a single branch of 
		science the Soviets preferred to call biocommunications. Soviet 
		biocommunications research is primarily concerned with exploring the 
		existence of a definite group of natural phenomena controlled by laws 
		that are not based on any known (energetic) influence. The types of 
		biocommunication (a.k.a. psychotronics) phenomena includes special 
		sensory biophysical activities, brain and mind control, telepathic 
		communications or bioinformation transceiving, bioluminescent and 
		bioenergetic emissions, and the effects of altered states of 
		consciousness on the human psyche. Psychotronics and remote viewing 
		provide capabilities that have obvious intelligence applications. The 
		Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies invested millions of dollars in 
		psychotronics R&amp;D because they understood this, and saw the potential 
		payoff for military and intelligence applications.</p>
		<p>The U.S. response to Soviet psychotronics R&amp;D programs was the Remote 
		Viewing program. In addition, the U.S. Army began the JEDI Project in 1983, which sought 
		to increase human potential using teachable models of 
		behavioral/physical excellent by unconventional means (Alexander et al., 
		1990). The JEDI Project was essentially a human-performance modeling 
		experiment based on neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) skills, whereby 
		advanced influence technologies to model excellence in human performance 
		was used. The program ran under the auspices of the Army INSCOM and the 
		Organizational Effectiveness School, and was sponsored by a U.S. 
		government interagency task force. Finally, it should be pointed out 
		that the program had successfully trained several hundred people, 
		including members of Congress (such as Al Gore, Jr. and Tom Downey), 
		before being terminated. There is a wealth of factual scientific 
		research data from around the world attesting to the physical reality of 
		p-Teleportation and related anomalous psi phenomena (Mitchell, 1974b; 
		Targ and Puthoff, 1977; Nash, 1978; Radin, 1997; Tart et al., 2002). The 
		skeptical reader should not be so quick to dismiss the subject matter in 
		this chapter, because one must remain open-minded about this subject and 
		consider p-Teleportation as worthy of further scientific exploration. 
		The psychotronics topic is controversial within the western scientific 
		community. The debate among scientists and scientific philosophers is</p>
		<p>highly charged at times, and becomes acrimonious to the point where 
		reputable skeptical scientists cease being impartial by refusing to 
		examine the experimental data or theories, and they prefer to bypass 
		rational discourse by engaging in ad hominem attacks and irrational 
		&quot;armchair&quot; arguments.</p>
		<p>P-Teleportation and related phenomena are truly anomalous, and they 
		challenge accepted modern scientific paradigm. Lightman and Gingerich (1991) wrote, &quot;Scientists 
		are reluctant to change paradigms for the purely psychological reasons 
		that the familiar is often more comfortable than the unfamiliar and that 
		inconsistencies in belief are uncomfortable.&quot; And theories change over 
		time when anomalies enter the picture. Anomalies are particularly 
		helpful for they point to the inadequacies of an old model and point the 
		way to a new one. Anomalous scientific facts are unexpected and 
		difficult to explain within an existing conceptual framework. Kuhn 
		(1970) describes scientific discovery as a complex process, in which an 
		anomalous fact of nature is recognized, and then followed by a change in 
		conceptual framework (i.e., paradigm) that makes the new fact no longer 
		an anomaly. Kuhn stated that, &quot;Discovery commences with the awareness of 
		anomaly, that is, with the recognition that nature has somehow violated 
		the preinduced expectations that govern normal science.&quot; This statement neatly 
		describes exactly what transpired during the historical revolution that took place in 
		physics between the classical mechanics/electrodynamics age in the 19</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="1">th
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">century and the 
		quantum/atomic/nuclear/relativistic age in the 20</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="1">th
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">century. And this isn’t the 
		only time in human history that scientific paradigms have dramatically 
		changed. The discovery of p-Teleportation already commenced in the 20</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="1">th
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">century, so let us continue 
		the discovery and create a new physics paradigm for the 21</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="1">st
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">century.</p>
